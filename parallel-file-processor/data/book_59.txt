  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.
  A superscript is denoted by ^x or ^{xx}, for example y^e or X^{mas}.

  Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ⅓ ¼ etc; other fractions are
  shown in the form a-b/c, for example 5/2 or 8-3/7.

  Breves and macrons are accurately represented (ă ĕ ā ē etc). Many
  other unusual characters are displayed using Unicode combining
  diacriticals. The display software on the device may sometimes
  fail to display a combined character.

  The old long s character ſ is used exactly as in the original
  text.

  The latin ligatures ﬀ ﬁ ﬂ ﬃ ﬄ are displayed as one Unicode
  character. However older ligatures are displayed as separate
  characters; these include ct, st, ſt, ſh, ſi, ſl, ſb, ſk, ſſ, fſ,
  ſſi.

  Footnotes are indicated by * † ‡ or § as in the original text,
  and have not been moved from their position in the printed text.
  Thirteen other footnote anchors are denoted by [number], as in
  the original text, and those footnotes have also been left in
  place at the end of their table or text section.

  The tables in this book are best viewed using a monospace font.
  Foreign alphabet characters in a table may alter the column
  alignment.

  The BIBLE ORTHOGRAPHY section has a very wide and very long
  table, up to 90 characters in width, which may be truncated on
  some older display devices.

  The ALPHABET and BLACK LETTER sections have the Gothic characters
  in tilde ~x~ markup since there are no Unicode codepoints for them. In
  browsers and ereaders they can be displayed with an appropriate
  choice of font that supports them. The DANISH and GERMAN and
  SWEDISH sections also have ~x~ markup for these characters.

  The IRISH section also has the Irish characters (insular script)
  in tilde ~x~ markup since there are no Unicode codepoints for them.
  (Browsers and ereaders can display them with an appropriate font.)

  This book uses characters from many different alphabets.
  Unicode codepoints are used whenever possible, but some printed
  characters have no codepoint. These are represented in this etext
  by [#] for a single character or dipthong and by [###] for a word
  or phrase.

  Some characters with valid codepoints may not display properly on
  some handheld devices. Without proper rendering support, you may
  see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.

  All the Alphabet tables are displayed as an Illustration in
  browsers and ereaders, as well as a text table.

  Tables on p104 to p161 show the count of letters on a sheet.
  The first table is displayed in full. Only the table header and
  the first row of data is displayed in all subsequent tables.
  The printed book had over three hundred of these tables on
  fifty-eight pages.

  Tables on p273 to p292. The first JOBS table is displayed in full.
  Only the table header and the first row of data is displayed in
  all subsequent tables. The printed book had twenty pages of these
  tables.

  Tables of Imposition on p335 to p400. Many of the numerical
  signatures on a page were printed upside down in the original
  book. This is indicated in this etext by putting the number in
  brackets, for example [14] or [B2].

  Tables on p598 to p643. The first table is displayed in full.
  Only the table header and the first row of data is displayed in
  all subsequent tables. The printed book had over one hundred of
  these tables on forty-six pages.

  Tables of signatures on p761 to p773. These tables are displayed
  in full.

  The citation _M._ refers to Joseph Moxon, a 17th-century
  English printer.

  Some other minor text changes are noted at the end of the book.

PREFACE.


Books of this class, themselves series of explanations, require fewer
prefatory remarks than those of any other; yet I cannot allow the
present work to go before the public without availing myself of this
privilege of authors. It affords me an opportunity of acknowledging,
which I do most gratefully, the kind and valuable assistance I have
received during my protracted labours, and of saying a few words on
the History of Printing, the limits of the book, the style of writing
adopted, and on the introduction of subjects that at a first glance
may appear to have but little or no connexion with the art.

I am indebted to Mr. Fehon, of Mr. Bentley’s establishment, Bangor
House, Shoe Lane, for the valuable article on Records, who is,
perhaps, more competent than any other printer in the kingdom for
such an undertaking; and also for his judicious opinions during the
progress of the work. Mr. Murray kindly prepared the specimens of
electrotype by his improved method, for which method he received a
premium from the Society of Arts. To Mr. Knight I am obliged for
permission to copy the list of botanical terms from his Encyclopædia.
From the letter founderies of Mr. Caslon, of Messrs. Figgins, and of
Messrs. Thorowgood and Besley, I have obtained the various alphabets,
&c., and am happy to acknowledge the courteous manner in which these
and other kindnesses were granted. To other friends who feel an
interest in the work, and have rendered me their services, I beg to
tender my sincere thanks. The books quoted are each mentioned with
every quotation, therefore there will be no necessity to recapitulate
them here; I may, however, state, that they are the works of standard
authors, as it has been my endeavour to refer to the opinions of men
whose talents and learning are generally acknowledged, rather than to
opinions perhaps more pertinent in works but little known.

The origin of the art is involved in obscurity, there being no clue
by which it can be traced, yet it is doubtless of very early date:
some authors maintain that printing was practised during the building
of Babylon. It is not my intention, however, to enter upon this
inquiry here, as it is probable, if my health continue, that I shall
embody the facts and information I have been so long collecting on
this subject in another work. The dates given of the introduction
of the practice into Europe by previous writers are unquestionably
erroneous, as we have conclusive evidence of its being followed as a
profession for nearly a century before the earliest date they give.
There has, in reality, hitherto been but little said on the History
or Practice of Printing, the numerous books on the subject being
chiefly copies from one or two of the earliest writers. The object
in the present undertaking was that of making a purely practical
work: one that might meet every exigence of the printer whilst in the
exercise of his art, and one that would serve as a book of reference
to the author, the librarian, and, in fact, to every one interested
in books or their production.

It will be observed that Moxon’s book has been frequently referred
to, and in many instances quoted from. This I was induced to do in
consequence of the quantity of useful matter it contains, and more
especially in order to point out and contrast the then method of
printing with the present. (Where the letter _M_ is used it refers
to this author.) The intermediate stages, where improvements or
alterations have occurred, are also noticed; so that the practical
history of the art is complete from the year 1683, when Moxon
published, to the present time.

The Statutes at Large I have carefully gone through from their
commencement; all the acts of parliament that in any way refer to
printing, and unrepealed, I have introduced: so that the Printer has
here all the Statute Law in existence for his guidance in conducting
his business.

The List of Abbreviations will be found extensive, and, I trust,
valuable, as until now there has been no printed list of many of
them. The interpretations have been obtained by comparing the
writings of contemporary authors, and by consulting those of my
friends who have made the early writers their study.

All the alphabets are taken from the best grammars in each language,
in preference to the more easy, but less correct method, of copying
the letters from any indifferent book printed in the characters of
the respective languages. I have confined myself to those languages
of which the characters are in the British founderies.

Whether my views are right or wrong respecting the orthography,
punctuation, and the capital letters of the Bible, rests with the
public to determine. I cannot consent to give an opinion in favour
of the changes that fashion, prejudice, or even the rules of grammar
have introduced, which are now adopted in general writing, until we
have another authorized version of the Bible, but think the more
literally we copy the present the better, otherwise the discrepancies
will soon be notorious.

The article on Imposing is of considerable length; yet I could not,
in justice to the work, curtail it: the tables might even have been
still more numerous, and yet serviceable, had the limits of the book
permitted; as it is, they are much more extensive than any tables
hitherto published. Men from the country having been but little used
to book-work, find themselves at a loss on entering a town-house in
this part of their business.

In printing topographical works, copies of early acts of parliament,
state papers of the middle ages, or books published soon after the
introduction of printing, when there were no general rules for either
writing or spelling, the list of characters and abbreviations under
the head of Records will be found invaluable. My kind friend Mr.
Fehon has spent many years of his life in investigating this subject,
and has here condensed most of what will be valuable to the Printer.

Electrotype, although quite in its infancy, promises to be of great
utility in the arts, and not the least so in that of printing. I have
therefore thought it right to give some account of it, together with
specimens, amongst which will be found an electrotype copy of a page
of types: it is imperfect, but I believe it is the first that has
been published.

No detailed account of the process of producing fine presswork has
before appeared. This circumstance I cannot otherwise explain than
by supposing it to arise from the jealous feeling that exists in the
bosoms of many of those who are masters of the practice. On speaking
to them of the value a detailed statement would be, I have been told
that there were already a sufficiency of men who knew it, and that
there was no necessity to deprive them of their advantages. Having
paid particular attention to this department, and having produced
works of this character that have been highly applauded, I have given
a detailed account of all the minutiæ of so valuable a branch of the
business.

Printing from engravings on wood is also a subject that has
particularly interested me, the practice of which I have given at
length: the result of my experience confirms the opinion that the
press is infinitely superior to the machine for this description of
work.

Having prepared the bulk of the matter prior to going to press, I
thought it might be safely stated that the whole would be comprised
in fourteen numbers. Yet, on revising, I found that some important
articles had not been touched upon, and that others perfectly new
(electrotype, &c.) had sprung up during the progress of printing; so
that either the book must have been left incomplete (had the first
arrangement been adhered to), or three more numbers must be added,
and thus every branch that pertained to the practice be embraced. I
trust none will regret that the latter plan has been adopted. With
regard to the style of writing--I am now an old man, and perhaps may
be, in some degree, wedded to the writings as well as the customs of
my youth; therefore the quaintness of expression, which my friends
have noticed, may possibly be more marked than I am aware of; yet the
manner is not wholly unintentional. To some persons simple language
may not have the attractions that are presented by the writings of
many authors of the present day, whose chief study is elegance of
expression; but do we not, by adopting this flowery style, lose in
clearness, in strength, in conciseness? Yes, and, I think, even in
beauty; and when it is considered that it was the intention to make
the book one of practical instruction, and that it was written with
the hope that it might be placed in the hands of each printer’s
boy on entering the business, I trust this sin of inelegance may
be pardoned. No one but the compiler of a dictionary can conceive
the unwearied labour that is requisite for its completion. Having
possessed greater opportunities than most men for the present
undertaking, yet have I been upwards of half a century in collecting
the materials; not, perhaps, having entertained the idea of
publishing during the whole of this period, still never neglecting
to amass every species of information that might be made available.
On going over such an extent of ground much has been culled that
would either never have been known to me, or, if known, would have
been forgotten, had the book been more hastily got up; and all those
subjects, a knowledge of which, at first, may appear irrelevant or
useless, will in practice be found highly necessary, there having
been no dictionary or book of reference kept in the printing offices
to which the workmen could apply. Should the work prove less useful
than I could wish it, the fault is in myself, and not in the subject;
but if on its perusal the young be instructed, the knowledge of the
more mature workman be refreshed and confirmed, and the general
reader find its utility as a book of reference, then have I nothing
to regret, but much to be grateful for. Lord Bacon says, “Every man
is a debtor to his profession, from the which, as men do of course
seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought they of duty to
endeavour themselves by way of amends to be a help thereunto.”

ART OF PRINTING.

“ABBREVIATIONS

are characters, or else marks on letters, to signify either a word
or syllable. & is the character for _and_, y^e is _the_ abbreviated,
y^t is _that_ abbreviated; and several other such. Straight strokes
over any of the vowels abbreviate m or n. They have been much used
by printers in old times, to shorten or get in matter; but now are
wholly left off as obsolete.”--_Moxon._ In reprints of old books,
where the original is closely followed, we occasionally meet with ɋ
as an abbreviation of _que_: this mark of contraction for _ue_ was
attached to the q, and was originally used solely for that purpose;
for the convenience of using the q without it, the abbreviation was
afterwards cast separate, and by degrees it was adopted as a point or
stop to divide a sentence, becoming the semicolon, the next in order
to the comma.

Some few authors yet retain the _;_ after a _q_, for the termination
_ue_, which appears to be the proper mark.

Abbreviations “occur very frequently, and are often the occasion
of perplexity to readers less familiarly acquainted with them, in
the early-printed books. These also originated from the idea which
the first Printers entertained of making their books as much as
possible resemble manuscripts. That they should perpetually occur
in manuscripts is natural enough; for the librarii, or writers
of manuscripts, necessarily had recourse to them to shorten
their labours. These abbreviations, in the infancy of Printing,
were perhaps to be excused; but it seems they multiplied to so
preposterous an extent that it was found necessary to publish a
book, both in the Gothic and Roman character, to explain their
meaning.”--_Beloe’s Anecdotes of Literature, &c._ _See_ DOMESDAY

ACCENTED LETTERS.

“In English, the accentual marks are chiefly used in spelling-books
and dictionaries, to mark the syllables which require a particular
stress of the voice in pronunciation.

“The stress is laid on long and short syllables indiscriminately.
In order to distinguish the one from the other, some writers of
dictionaries have placed the grave on the former, and the acute on
the latter, in this manner: ‘Mìnor, míneral, lìvely, líved, rìval,
ríver.’

“The proper mark to distinguish a long syllable is this ̄: as,
‘Rōsy:’ and a short one thus ̆: as ‘Fŏlly.’ This last mark is called
a breve.

“A diæresis, thus marked ¨, consists of two points placed over one of
the two vowels that would otherwise make a diphthong, and parts them
into two syllables: as, ‘Creätor, coädjutor, aërial.’

“A circumflex, thus marked ^, when placed over some vowel of a word,
denotes a long syllable: as, ‘Euphrâtes.’”--_Murray._

The c _à la queue_, or the c _with a tail_, is a French sort,
and sounds like _ss_, when it stands before _a o u_, as in _ça_,
_garçon_. To make a tail to a capital C, a small figure of 5 with
the top dash cut away, thus ⦢, and justified close to the bottom
of the letter, answers the purpose, when it is required; for the
letter-founders do not cast this letter with a tail, neither in the
capitals nor small capitals. Ç.

The ñ is used in the Spanish language, and is pronounced like a
double _n_, or rather like _ni_; but short and quick, as in España.
It is a sort which is used in the middle of words, but rarely at the
beginning.

In the Welsh language, ŵ and ŷ, as well as the other circumflex
letters, are used either to direct the pronunciation, as in
_yngŵydd_, in presence; _ynghŷd_, together; or else for distinction
sake; as, _mwg_, a mug; _mŵg_, smoke; _hyd_, to, until; _hŷd_, length.

ACTS OF PARLIAMENT.

There are various Acts of Parliament which affect printers, and
inflict penalties for the neglect or violation of their provisions.
Many printers frequently subject themselves to penalties, which are
in many instances very heavy, through ignorance of those laws. To
enable them to avoid these penalties, and also to show the legal
restrictions on the business, I have taken great pains to examine the
whole of the Statutes at Large, and to extract from them all such
clauses as are in force, that affect the trade.--See the respective
subjects.

  herein-before limited and appointed for that Purpose, the Printer
  and Publisher of such Pamphlet, Literary Work, or Paper, and the

  and pay the Sum of Twenty Pounds for every such Offence; and in
  any Action, Information, or other Proceeding for the Recovery

  and Penalties, contained in or imposed by the several Acts of
  Parliament relating to the Duties on Advertisements and Sea

ALGEBRAIC CHARACTERS.

+ is the sign of addition; as _c_ + _d_ denotes that _d_ is to be
added to _c_.

- is the sign of subtraction; thus, _c_ - _d_ implies that _d_ is to
be subtracted from _c_.

× is the sign of multiplication; as _c_ × _d_ means the product of
_c_ and _d_.

÷ is the sign of division; as _c_ ÷ _d_ signifies the quotient of _c_
and _d_.

= is the sign of equality; thus _c_ + _d_ = _e_ means the sum of _c_
and _d_ equals _e_.

√ is the sign of the square root; thus √_x_ denotes the square root
of _x_.

∛ is the sign of the cube root, and generally any root of a quantity
may be denoted by this sign, with the index of the root placed over
it; thus ∛_x_ signifies the cube root, ∜_x_ the biquadrate root, &c.;
but they may likewise be represented by the reciprocals of these
indices; as _x_^½, _x_^⅓, implying the square and cube roots of _x_.

  A vinculum is a line drawn over several quantities, and means that
                               __________
  they are taken together, as √_ax_ + _b_ signifies the
  square root of _ax_ and _b_.--_Phillips’s Compendium of
  Algebra._ 12mo. 1824.

ALPHABET.

A perfect alphabet of the English language, and, indeed, of every
other language, would contain a number of letters, precisely equal
to the number of simple articulate sounds belonging to the language.
Every simple sound would have its distinct character; and that
character be the representative of no other sound. But this is far
from being the state of the English alphabet. It has more original
sounds than distinct significant letters; and, consequently, some of
these letters are made to represent, not one sound alone, but several
sounds. This will appear by reflecting, that the sounds signified
by the united letters _th_, _sh_, _ng_, are elementary, and have
no single appropriate characters, in our alphabet; and the letters
_a_ and _u_ represent the different sounds heard in _hat_, _hate_,
_hall_; and _but_, _bull_, _mute_.

The letters of the English language, called the English Alphabet, are
twenty-six in number.--_Murray._

The following is a list of the Roman, Italic, and Old English
Characters, being those used at the present day in England. The Roman
and Italic are also used by most of the European nations.

[Illustration: English Alphabet with Old English characters]

  A a  _A_ _a_  ~A a~  _ai_.
  B b  _B_ _b_  ~B b~  _bee_.
  C c  _C_ _c_  ~C c~  _see_.
  D d  _D_ _d_  ~D d~  _dee_.
  E e  _E_ _e_  ~E e~  _ee_.
  F f  _F_ _f_  ~F f~  _ef_.
  G g  _G_ _g_  ~G g~  _jee_.
  H h  _H_ _h_  ~H h~  _haitch_.
  I i  _I_ _i_  ~I i~  _i_ or _eye_.
  J j  _J_ _j_  ~J j~  _jay_.
  K k  _K_ _k_  ~K k~  _kay_.
  L l  _L_ _l_  ~L l~  _el_.
  M m  _M_ _m_  ~M m~  _em_.
  N n  _N_ _n_  ~N n~  _en_.
  O o  _O_ _o_  ~O o~  _o_.
  P p  _P_ _p_  ~P p~  _pee_.
  Q q  _Q_ _q_  ~Q q~  _cue_.
  R r  _R_ _r_  ~R r~  _ar_.
  S s  _S_ _s_  ~S s~  _ess_.
  T t  _T_ _t_  ~T t~  _tee_.
  U u  _U_ _u_  ~U u~  _u_ or _you_.
  V v  _V_ _v_  ~V v~  _vee_.
  W w  _W_ _w_  ~W w~  _double u_.
  X x  _X_ _x_  ~X x~  _eks_.
  Y y  _Y_ _y_  ~Y y~  _wy_.
  Z z  _Z_ _z_  ~Z z~  _zed_.

For the characters of the different languages, _see_ their respective
names, ARABIC, &c.

Tacquet, an able mathematician, in his Arithmeticiæ Theor., _Amst._
1704, states, that the various combinations of the twenty-four
letters (without any repetition) will amount to

                   620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000.

Thus it is evident, that twenty-four letters will admit of an
infinity of combinations and arrangements, sufficient to represent
not only all the conceptions of the mind, but all words in all
languages whatever.

Clavius the Jesuit, who also computes these combinations, makes them
to be only 5,852,616,738,497,664,000.

As there are more sounds in some languages than in others, it follows
of course that the number of elementary characters, or letters,
must vary in the alphabets of different languages. The Hebrew,
Samaritan, and Syriac alphabets, have twenty-two letters; the Arabic,
twenty-eight; the Persic, and Egyptian or Coptic, thirty-two; the
present Russian, forty-one; the Shanscrit, fifty; the Cashmirian and
Malabaric are still more numerous.--_Astle._


ALTERATION OF MARGIN.

In works that are published in different sizes, this is the changing
of the margin from the small paper to the large paper edition, when
at press.

After the margin for the small paper copies is finally made, the
additional width of the gutters, the backs, and the heads, is
ascertained in the same manner, by folding a sheet of the large
paper, that it was in the first instance. The additional pieces for
the change should, if possible, be in one piece for each part. _See_
MARGIN.

Folios, quartos, and octavos, are the sizes most usually printed with
an alteration of margin; duodecimos are sometimes, but rarely; of
smaller sizes I never knew an instance.

The alteration of margin requires care, for it occasionally happens
that the sheet is imposed with the wrong furniture; and where it
happens to be in one form only, and that form is first laid on, it
sometimes passes undiscovered till a revise of the second form is
pulled, when the error is detected, but too late to rectify it; the
consequence must be, to cancel a part of the sheet, or to print the
reiteration with the margin also wrong; nay, sometimes both forms
are worked off with the furniture wrong, without being perceived
till the compositor comes to distribute, particularly when they are
printed at different presses. Such errors destroy the uniformity of
the book, and spoil its appearance.

These mistakes can only be avoided by care and attention on the
part of the compositor, the reader, and the pressman; but I would
recommend that the furniture for the alteration should be cut of
different lengths from the furniture of the small paper: in octavos
the gutters and backs should be the exact length of the page, and be
always imposed within the sidestick; and the head should be the width
of the two pages and the gutter, and be imposed within the footstick.
This method of cutting the furniture of precise lengths for the
alteration, and locking it up within the side and foot sticks, will
not only distinguish it from the rest of the furniture, and from
the pieces that may be put in for the convenience of quoining the
form, but will also preserve it from being injured by the mallet and
shooting stick, in locking up, and by the indention of the quoins.

The same principle, of cutting the alteration to precise lengths, and
locking it up within the side and foot sticks, will hold good in all
other sizes, where it is required: in quartos, the pieces must be cut
to the length and width of the page; and in folios to the length of
the page only, as the margin of the head is regulated at the press.


ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

The following Customs used in Printing Offices in former times are
extracted from Moxon’s Mechanick Exercises, published in 1683, the
first practical work that appeared on the Art of Printing. I insert
them because I think it interesting to trace the old Customs, that
were established by printers to preserve Order among themselves;
and to show the changes that have taken place since that period. The
insertion of them in this place will also tend to preserve them, as
the original work is now very scarce, and this department of it has
been superseded by subsequent publications, which however, with the
exception of Mr. Hansard’s work, have not copied these Customs.


  “_Ancient Customs used in a Printing-house._

  “Every _Printing-house_ is by the Custom of Time out of mind,
  called a _Chappel_; and all the Workmen that belong to it are
  _Members of the Chappel_: and the Oldest Freeman is _Father of
  the Chappel_. I suppose the stile was originally conferred upon
  it by the courtesie of some great Churchman, or men, (doubtless
  when Chappels were in more veneration than of late years they
  have been here in _England_) who for the Books of Divinity that
  proceeded from a _Printing-house_, gave it the Reverend Title of
  _Chappel_.

  “There have been formerly Customs and By-Laws made and intended
  for the well and good Government of the _Chappel_, and for the
  more Civil and orderly deportment of all its Members while in the
  _Chappel_; and the Penalty for the breach of any of these Laws
  and Customs is in Printers Language called a _Solace_.

  “And the Judges of these _Solaces_, and other Controversies
  relating to the _Chappel_ or any of its Members, was plurality of
  Votes in the _Chappel_. It being asserted as a Maxim, _That the
  Chappel cannot Err_. But when any Controversie is thus decided,
  it always ends in the Good of the _Chappel_.

  “1. Swearing in the _Chappel_, a _Solace_.

  “2. Fighting in the _Chappel_, a _Solace_.

  “3. Abusive Language, or giving the Ly in the _Chappel_, a
  _Solace_.

  “4. To be Drunk in the _Chappel_, a _Solace_.

  “5. For any of the Workmen to leave his Candle burning at Night,
  a _Solace_.

  “6. If the _Compositer_ let fall his _Composing-stick_, and
  another take it up, a _Solace_.

  “7. Three _Letters_ and a _Space_ to lye under the _Compositers
  Case_, a _Solace_.

  “8. If a _Press-man_ let fall his _Ball_ or _Balls_, and another
  take it up, a _Solace_.

  “9. If a _Press-man_ leave his _Blankets_ in the _Tympan_ at Noon
  or Night, a _Solace_.

  “These _Solaces_ were to be bought off, for the good of the
  _Chappel_: Nor were the price of these _Solaces_ alike: For some
  were 12_d._ 6_d._ 4_d._ 2_d._ 1_d._ _ob._ according to the nature
  and quality of the _Solace_.

  “But if the Delinquent prov’d Obstinate or Refractory, and
  would not pay his _Solace_ at the Price of the _Chappel_, they
  _Solac’d_ him.

  “The manner of _Solacing_, thus.

  “The Workmen take him by force, and lay him on his Belly athwart
  the _Correcting-stone_, and held him there while another of the
  Work-men with a Paper-board, gave him 10_l._ _and a Purse_, viz.
  Eleven blows on his Buttocks; which he laid on according to his
  own mercy. For Tradition tells us, that about 50 years ago one
  was _Solaced_ with so much violence, that he presently P----d
  Blood; and shortly after dyed of it.

  “These nine _Solaces_ were all the _Solaces_ usually and
  generally accepted: yet in some particular _Chappels_ the
  Work-men did by consent make other _Solaces_, viz.

  “That it should be a _Solace_ for any of the Workmen to mention
  Joyning their Penny or more apiece to send for Drink.

  “To mention spending _Chappel-money_ till _Saturday_ night, or
  any other before agreed time.

  “To Play at _Quadrats_, or excite any of the _Chappel_ to Play at
  _Quadrats_; either for Money or Drink.

  “This _Solace_ is generally purchas’d by the Master-Printer; as
  well because it hinders the Workmens work, as because it Batters
  and spoils the Quadrats: For the manner how they Play with them
  is Thus: They take five or seven more m _Quadrats_ (generally of
  the _English Body_) and holding their Hand below the Surface of
  the _Correcting Stone_, shake them in their Hand, and toss them
  upon the _Stone_, and then count how many _Nicks_ upwards each
  man throws in three times, or any other number of times agreed
  on: And he that throws most Wins the Bett of all the rest, and
  stands out free, till the rest have try’d who throws fewest
  _Nicks_ upwards in so many throws; for all the rest are free: and
  he pays the Bett.

  “For any to _Take up a Sheet_, if he receiv’d _Copy-money_; Or
  if he receiv’d no _Copy-money_, and did _Take up a Sheet_, and
  carryed that Sheet or Sheets off the Printing-House till the
  whole Book was Printed off and Publisht.

  “Any of the Workmen may purchase a _Solace_ for any trivial
  matter, if the rest of the _Chappel_ consent to it. As if any of
  the Workmen Sing in the _Chappel_; he that is offended at it
  may, with the _Chappels_ Consent purchase a penny or two penny
  _Solace_ for any Workmans singing after the _Solace_ is made; Or
  if a Workman or a Stranger salute a Woman in the _Chappel_, after
  the making of the _Solace_, it is a _Solace_ of such a Value as
  is agreed on.

  “The price of all _Solaces_ to be purchased is wholly Arbitrary
  in the _Chappel_. And a Penny _Solace_ may perhaps cost the
  Purchaser Six Pence, Twelve Pence, or more for the _Good of the
  Chappel_.

  “Yet sometimes _Solaces_ may cost double the Purchase or more.
  As if some _Compositer_ have (to affront a _Press-man_) put a
  Wisp of Hay in the _Press-man’s Ball-Racks_; If the _Press-man_
  cannot well brook this affront, he will lay six Pence down on
  the _Correcting Stone_ to purchase a _Solace_ of twelve pence
  upon him that did it; and the _Chappel_ cannot in Justice refuse
  to grant it: because it tends to the _Good of the Chappel_:
  And being granted, it becomes every Members duty to make what
  discovery he can: because it tends to the farther _Good of the
  Chappel_: And by this means it seldom happens but the Agressor is
  found out.

  “Nor did _Solaces_ reach only the _Members of the Chappel_, but
  also Strangers that came into the _Chappel_, and offered affronts
  or indignities to the _Chappel_, or any of its Members; the
  _Chappel_ would determine it a _Solace_. Example,

  “It was a _Solace_ for any to come to the _King’s Printing-house_
  and ask for a Ballad.

  “For any to come and enquire of a _Compositer_, whether he had
  News of such a Galley at Sea.

  “For any to bring a Wisp of Hay, directed to any of the
  _Press-men_.

  “And such Strangers were commonly sent by some who knew the
  _Customs of the Chappel_, and had a mind to put a Trick upon the
  Stranger.

  “Other Customs were used in the _Chappel_, which were not
  _Solaces_, viz. Every new Workman to pay half a Crown; which
  is called his _Benvenue_: This _Benvenue_ being so constant a
  Custome is still lookt upon by all Workmen as the undoubted Right
  of the _Chappel_, and therefore never disputed; yet he who has
  not paid his _Benvenue_ is no Member of the _Chappel_ nor enjoys
  any benefit of _Chappel-Money_.

  “If a Journey-man Wrought formerly upon the same Printing House,
  and comes again to Work on it, pays but half a _Benvenue_.

  “If a Journey-man _Smout_ more or less on another Printing-House
  and any of the _Chappel_ can prove it, he pays half a _Benvenue_.

  “I told you before that abusive Language or giving the Lye was
  a _Solace_: But if in discourse, when any of the Workmen affirm
  any thing that is not believed, the _Compositer_ knocks with the
  back corner of his _Composing-stick_ against the lower Ledge of
  his _Lower Case_, and the _Press-man_ knocks the handles of his
  _Ball-stocks_ together: Thereby signifying the discredit they
  give to his Story.

  “It is now customary that Journey-men are paid for all Church
  Holy days that fall not on a _Sunday_, Whether they Work or
  no: And they are by Contract with the Master Printer paid
  proportionably for what they undertake to Earn every Working
  day, be it half a Crown, two Shillings, three Shillings, four
  Shillings, &c.

  “It is also customary for all the Journey-men to make every
  Year new Paper Windows, whether the old will serve again or no;
  Because that day they make them, the Master Printer gives them a
  _Way-goose_; that is, he makes them a good Feast, and not only
  entertains them at his own House, but besides, gives them Money
  to spend at the Ale-house or Tavern at Night; And to this Feast
  they invite the _Correcter_, _Founder_, _Smith_, _Joyner_, and
  _Inck-maker_, who all of them severally (except the _Correcter_
  in his own Civility) open their Purse-strings and add their
  Benevolence (which Workmen account their duty, because they
  generally chuse these Workmen) to the Master Printers: But from
  the _Correcter_ they expect nothing, because the Master Printer
  chusing him, the Workmen can do him no kindness.

  “These Way-gooses, are always kept about Bartholemew-tide.
  And till the Master-Printer have given this _Way-goose_, the
  journey-men do not use to work by Candle Light.

  “If a Journey-man marry, he pays half a Crown to the _Chappel_.

  “When his Wife comes to the _Chappel_, she pays six Pence: and
  then all the Journey-men joyn their two Pence apiece to Welcome
  her.

  “If a Journeyman have a Son born, he pays one Shilling.

  “If a Daughter born, six Pence.

  “The _Father_ of the _Chappel_ drinks first of _Chapel Drink_,
  except some other Journey-man have a _Token_; viz. Some agreed
  piece of Coin or Mettle markt by consent of the _Chappel_: for
  then producing that _Token_, he Drinks first. This _Token_ is
  always given to him who in the Round should have Drank, had the
  last _Chappel-drink_ held out. Therefore when _Chappel-drink
  comes in_, they generally say, _Who has the Token?_

  “Though these Customs are no _Solaces_; yet the _Chappel_
  Excommunicates the Delinquent; and he shall have no benefit of
  _Chappel-money_ till he have paid.

  “It is also customary in some Printing-houses that if the
  _Compositer_ or _Press-man_ make either the other stand still
  through the neglect of their contracted Task, that then he who
  neglected, shall pay him that stands still as much as if he had
  Wrought.

  “The Compositers are Jocosely called _Galley Slaves_: Because
  allusively they are as it were bound to their _Gallies_.

  “And the _Press-men_ are Jocosely called _Horses_: Because of the
  hard Labour they go through all day long.

  “An Apprentice when he is Bound pays half a Crown to the
  _Chappel_, and when he is made Free, another half Crown to the
  _Chappel_; but is yet no Member of the _Chappel_; And if he
  continue to Work Journey-work in the same House, he pays another
  half Crown, and is then a Member of the _Chappel_.

  “The Printers of _London_, Masters and Journey-men, have every
  Year a general Feast, which since the re-building of Stationers
  Hall is commonly kept there. This Feast is made by four Stewards,
  viz. two Masters and two Journey-men; which Stewards, with the
  Collection of half a Crown apiece of every Guest, defray the
  Charges of the whole Feast; And as they collect the Half-Crowns,
  they deliver every Guest a Ticket, wherein is specified the Time
  and Place they are to meet at, and the Church they are to go to:
  To which Ticket is affixed the Names and Seals of each Steward.

  “It is commonly kept on or about _May-day_: When, about ten
  a Clock in the Morning they meet at _Stationers Hall_, and
  from thence go to some Church thereabouts; Four Whifflers (as
  Servitures) by two and two walking before with White Staves in
  their Hands, and Red and Blew Ribbons hung Belt-wise upon their
  left Shoulders. Those go before to make way for the Company.
  Then walks the Beadle of the Company of _Stationers_, with the
  Company’s Staff in his Hand, and Ribbons as the Whifflers, and
  after him the Divine (whom the Stewards before ingag’d to Preach
  them a Sermon) and his Reader. Then the Stewards walk by two and
  two, with long White Wands in their Hands, and all the rest of
  the Company follows, till they enter the Church.

  “Then Divine Service begins, Anthems are Sung, and a Sermon
  Preached to suit the Solemnity: Which ended, they in the same
  order walk back again to _Stationers Hall_; where they are
  immediately entertain’d with the City Weights and other Musick:
  And as every Guest enters, he delivers his Ticket (which gives
  him Admittance) to a Person appointed by the Stewards to receive
  it.

  “The Master, Wardens and other Grandees of the Company (although
  perhaps no Printers) are yet commonly invited, and take their
  Seats at the upper Table, and the rest of the Company where it
  pleases them best. The Tables being furnish’d with variety of
  Dishes of the best Cheer: And to make the entertainment more
  splendid is usher’d in with Loud Musick. And after Grace is said
  (commonly by the Minister that Preach’d the Sermon) every one
  Feasts himself with what he likes Best; whiles the Whifflers and
  other Officers Wait with Napkins, Plates, Beer, Ale, and Wine,
  of all sorts, to accommodate each Guest according to his desire.
  And to make their Cheer go cheerfuller down, are entertained with
  Musick and Songs all Dinner time.

  “Dinner being near ended, the Kings and the Dukes Healths is
  begun, by the several Stewards at the several Tables, and goes
  orderly round to all the Guests.

  “And whiles these Healths are Drinking, each Steward sets a Plate
  on each Table, beginning at the upper end, and conveying it
  downwards, to Collect the Benevolence of Charitable minds towards
  the relief of _Printers_ Poor Widows. And at the same time each
  Steward distributes a Catalogue of such Printers as have held
  Stewards ever since the Feast was first kept, _viz._ from the
  Year of Christ 1621.

  “After Dinner, and Grace said, the Ceremony of Electing new
  Stewards for the next Year begins: Therefore the present Stewards
  withdraw into another Room: And put Garlands of Green Lawrel, or
  of Box on their Heads, and White-wands in their Hands, and are
  again Usher’d out of the withdrawing Room by the Beadle of the
  Company, with the Companys Staff in his Hand, and with Musick
  sounding before them: Then follows one of the Whifflers with a
  great Bowl of White-wine and Sugar in his Right Hand, and his
  Whifflers Staff in his Left: Then follows the Eldest Steward, and
  then another Whiffler, as the first, with a Bowl of White-wine
  and Sugar before the second Steward, and in like manner another
  Whiffler before the Third, and another before the Fourth. And
  thus they walk with Musick sounding before them three times round
  the Hall: And in a fourth round the first Steward takes the Bowl
  of his Whiffler and Drinks to one (whom before he resolved on) by
  the Title of Mr. Steward Elect: And taking the Garland off his
  own Head puts it upon the Steward Elects Head. At which Ceremony
  the Spectators clap their Hands, and such as stand on the Tables
  or Benches, so Drum with their Feet that the whole Hall is
  filled with Noise, as applauding the Choice. Then the present
  Steward takes out the Steward Elect, giving him the Right
  Hand, and walks with him Hand in Hand, behind the three present
  Stewards another Round about the Hall: And in the next Round, as
  aforesaid, the second Steward Drinks to another with the same
  Ceremony as the first did; and so the Third Steward, and so the
  Fourth, and then all walk one Round more Hand in Hand about the
  Hall, that the Company may take notice of the Stewards Elect. And
  so ends the Ceremony of the Day.

  “This Ceremony being over, such as will go their ways; but others
  that stay, are Diverted with Musick, Songs, Dancing, Farcing, &c.
  till at last they all find it time to depart.”

ANTEPENULTIMATE.

The last syllable but two of a word.


APOSTROPHE.

An apostrophe, marked thus ’, is used to abbreviate or shorten a
word: as, _’tis_ for _it is_; _tho’_ for _though_; _e’en_ for _even_;
_judg’d_ for _judged_. Its chief use is to show the genitive case of
nouns: as, “A man’s property; a woman’s ornament.”--_Murray._

Authors frequently, in the hurry of writing, abbreviate their words
and use the apostrophe; but a compositor, however his copy may be
written, should never abbreviate any word in prose works, except he
be particularly ordered so to do.

The apostrophe is also used in printing to close an extract, or to
show where it finishes; and in dialogues, frequently, to close each
person’s speech; in both cases it is usually put close to the end
of the word, without any space before it, except where the word
finishes with a kerned letter, and then a hair space, or one just
sufficient for their preservation is used; when it comes after an
ascending letter, a hair space should also be put between them. _See_
QUOTATION.

The apostrophe is not used for abbreviation in the Holy Scriptures,
nor in Forms of Prayers; but every thing there is set full and at
length. To this even the Latin law language had regard, and did not
shorten the word DOMINUS, when it had reference to God; whereas _Dom.
Reg._ is put where our Lord the King is understood.

ARABIC.

Arabic is read from right to left. The method of composing it is
upside down, and after the points are placed at the top of the
letters it is turned in the composing stick.

Mr. Astle says, “The old Arabic characters are said to be of very
high antiquity; for Ebn Hashem relates, that an inscription in it was
found in Yaman, as old as the time of Joseph. These traditions may
have given occasion to some authors to suppose the Arabians to have
been the inventors of letters; and Sir Isaac Newton supposes, that
Moses learned the alphabet from the Midianites, who were Arabians.

“The Arabian alphabet consists of twenty-eight letters, which are
somewhat similar to the ancient Kufic, in which characters the first
copies of the Alcoran were written.

“The present Arabic characters were formed by Ebn Moklah, a learned
Arabian, who lived about 300 years after Mahomet. We learn from the
Arabian writers themselves, that their alphabet is not ancient.”

Seven different styles of writing are used by the Arabs in the
present day. Herbin has given descriptions and specimens of them in
an Essay on Oriental Caligraphy at the end of his “Développemens des
Principes de la Langue Arabe Moderne.”

The alphabets are copied, and the following observations are
translated, from Baron De Sacy’s Arabic Grammar, 2 vol. 8vo. _Paris_,
1831.

7. It was long thought that the written character which the Arabs
most generally use at the present day, and which is called _neskhi_,
was invented only about the commencement of the 4th century of the
Hegira; and, indeed, it appears that the Arabs, before this epoch,
used another character which we call Cufic, or Coufic, from the town
of Coufa, where, doubtlessly, it first was brought into use. This
character has so great a resemblance to the ancient Syriac character
called _Estranghelo_, that it is extremely probable that the Arabs
borrowed it from the people of Syria. Nevertheless, even the name of
Coufic, given to this character, proves that it is not that which
the Arabs of the Hedjaz made use of in the time of Mohammed, the
town from which it takes its name having been founded only in A. H.
17. Some papyri lately discovered in Egypt have apprised us that
the character which the Arabs of the Hedjaz made use of in the 1st
century of the Hegira, differed little from that which is called
_neskhi_. Moreover, in the time of Mohammed, writing was, among these
Arabs, if we may believe their historic traditions, an invention very
recent, and its use was very circumscribed. But it was otherwise,
according to all appearances, among the Arabs, whether nomadic or
settled, of Yemen, of Irak, and perhaps of Central Arabia; for,
although we do not know the characters which the Arabs made use of in
very ancient times, and the few traditions which Mussulman writers
have handed down to us on this subject throw but very little light
on this point of antiquity, it is scarcely possible to imagine that
all the people of Arabia should have remained without a written
character until the 6th century of the Christian era. The Jewish
and the Christian religions were widely diffused in Arabia; the
Ethiopians, who professed the latter faith, had even conquered Yemen,
and retained its possession for a long while: another part of Arabia
had frequent political relations with Persia, and it is found at
many times in a state of dependence, more or less immediate, on the
kings of the Sassanian dynasty. Under these circumstances, can it
be reasonably supposed that the Arabs were ignorant of the use of
writing? Is it not more likely that what history tells us of their
ignorance in this respect is true only of some tribes, of those, for
example, who were settled at Mecca or in the neighbourhood of that
town; and that the character which these received from Mesopotamia,
a short time previous to Mohammed, having been employed to write the
Kurán, soon spread over all Arabia with the Mohammedan religion,
and caused the other more ancient sorts of writing to fall into
desuetude? It is true, no vestige of these characters remains, but if
one may be permitted to hazard a conjecture, they did not materially
differ from that ancient alphabet, common to a great many nations
of the East, and of which the Phœnician and Palmyrenian monuments,
as well as the ruins of Nakschia-Roustam and of Kirmanschah, and
the coins of the Sassanides, have perpetuated the knowledge even to
our own days. Perhaps another sort of writing, peculiar to Southern
Arabia, was only a variety of the Ethiopic.

8. The Arabs of Africa have a character differing slightly from that
made use of by the Arabs of Asia. I do not comprehend, among the
Africans, the inhabitants of Egypt, for they use the same character
as the Asiatics. For the sake of comparison I have shown the manner
in which the Jews and Syrians employ their peculiar character when
they are writing in the Arabic language.

I do not speak here of the character called _talik_ تعلیق‎ or
_nestalik_ نستعليق‎, because it is peculiar to the Persians. I may
say as much of the different kinds of writing proper to the Turks
or to the people of India, among whom the Mussulmans of Persia have
introduced their characters with their language and religion.

_Observations on the Alphabet._

9. The letters of the Arabic alphabet have not always been arranged
in the order in which they are at the present day. The Arabs
themselves have preserved the remembrance of a more ancient order,
and the value which they give to the letters when they are employed
as figures, confirms the existence of this order, which they term
_aboudjed_, in like manner as we call the alphabet _a be ce_.

The twenty-two first letters of the Arabic alphabet, thus arranged,
are the same, and follow the same order, as those of the Hebrews and
Syrians. It is very probable that the Arabs, as well as the others,
had only these twenty-two letters originally, and that the other
six were added afterwards, though it is not possible to determine
precisely the time at which this addition took place.

10. The _lam-elif_ لا‎ is not a character _per se_, but only a
junction of the _lam_ ل‎ to the _élif_ ا‎.

12. The alphabet is divided into eight columns: the first contains
the numbers which indicate the order of the letters; the second,
the names of the letters; the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth show
the different forms of which each letter is susceptible when it is,
first, entirely isolated; second, joined only to that which precedes
it; third, joined to that which precedes and also to that which
follows it; and, fourth, joined only to that which follows it. There
are several letters which are never joined to those which follow
them: this causes the blanks in the fifth and sixth columns. It is as
well, however, to observe, that when the د‎, the ذ‎, the ر‎, the
‎ز‎, and the و‎, are found followed by ه‎, at the end of a word,
they may be joined together.

13. Many letters differ from each other only by the absence or
addition of one or more points. These points are called by the Arabs
‎نُقْطَةٌ;‎ we call them diacritical points, a term derived from the
Greek, signifying _distinctive_.

30. The _elif_ ا‎, when marked with the _hamza_ ء‎, is not a vowel.
The sound may then be compared to the _h_ not aspirated in the French
words _habit_, _histoire_, _homme_, _Hubert_.

The _elif_, without the _hamza_, has no pronunciation of its own; it
serves only to prolong the vowel _a_ which precedes it; sometimes
this vowel and the _elif_ which follows, take a strong sound
approaching to the French _i_.

31. The ب‎ answers to _B_, and the ت‎ to _T_. In Africa the
pronunciation of ث‎ is often given to the letter ت‎.

32. The ث‎ answers to the English _th_, as in the word _thing_;
and it cannot be rendered in French better than by the two letters
_TS_. The greater part of the Arabs make no distinction between the
pronunciation of this letter and that of ت‎; some indeed regard as
vicious the pronunciation here indicated. The Persians and the Turks
pronounce the ث‎ as the French _ç_; I render it ordinarily by _TH_.

33. The ج‎ represents a sound similar to that of the Italian _g_,
when followed by an _i_, as in _giardino_, and may be expressed by
the letters _DJ_. This pronunciation, which is most used, is that of
the people of Arabia and Syria; but in Egypt, at Muscat, and perhaps
in some other provinces, the ج‎ is pronounced as _g_ hard followed
by an _a_ or _o_, as in _garrison_, _agony_.

34. The ح‎ indicates an aspiration stronger than that of the French
_h_ in the words _heurter_, _héros_, and similar to the manner in
which the Florentines pronounce the _c_ before _a_ and _o_. At the
end of words, this aspiration is still more difficult to imitate. For
example, the word لُوح‎ is pronounced as _louèh_.

35. The خ‎ answers to the _ch_ of the Germans when it is preceded by
an _a_ or an _o_, as in the words _nacht_, _noch_.

36. The د‎ answers exactly to _D_.

37. The ذ‎ represents a sound which is to that of د‎ very nearly
as the ث‎ is to that of ت‎. It is expressed in French by the two
letters _DZ_ or _DH_. Most nations who speak the Arabic language make
no difference between this letter and the preceding; they pronounce
both as our _D_. Some others, as the Arabs of Muscat, pronounce the
‎ذ‎ as the French _Z_, and such is the usage of the Persians and
Turks.

38. The ر‎ answers exactly to _R_; and the ز‎ to _Z_.

39. The س‎ answers to the sound of _s_, when it is at the beginning
of words. When this letter is found, in Arabic words, between two
vowels, it may be rendered by _ç_, that its pronunciation may not
be confounded with that of _z_, which takes the sound of _s_, in
similar cases, in French words.

40. The sound of ش‎ is exactly rendered by the French _CH_, (_sj_
Dutch, _sch_ German, _sh_ English). Many French writers render it by
the three letters _SCH_, in order that foreigners may not confound
its pronunciation with that of خ‎, which is the custom I generally
follow.

From the manner in which the Arabs of Spain transcribed Spanish in
Arabic characters, there is reason to believe that they pronounced
the ش‎ as an _s_ strongly articulated, and the س‎ as the _ç_ or _z_.

41. The ص‎ answers to our _S_, but it ought to be pronounced a
little more strongly than the س‎, or with a sort of emphasis. It
appears that the pronunciation of the two letters has often been
confounded, as may be seen in the marginal notes of some copies
of the Kurán, in the books of the Druses, and in modern Egyptian
manuscripts.

42. The ض‎ answers to _D_ pronounced more strongly than the French
_d_, or with a sort of emphasis. The Persians and Turks pronounce it
as the French _z_, other nations, as _DS_. In rendering Arabic names
into French, in order to express the ض‎, the two letters _DH_ ought
to be used.

43. The ط‎ answers to the _T_ articulated strongly and emphatically.
If a person should wish, in writing in French, to distinguish it from
‎ت‎, it may be rendered by _TH_.

44. The ظ‎ differs in no respect, in pronunciation, from ض‎, and
they may be rendered in the same manner. These two letters are very
often confounded in manuscripts. It ought to be observed, however,
that in Egypt the ظ‎ is often pronounced as a _Z_, emphatically.

45. The peculiar pronunciation of ع‎ cannot be expressed by any of
the letters used among the nations of Europe.

The manner in which the Piedmontese pronounce the _ñ_ appears to me
to approach something to the sound ع‎. Examples: _cañ_ chien, _boñ_
bon, _boña_ bonne.

46. The غ‎ represents a sound which partakes of both _r_ and _g_.
Some writers have rendered this letter by _rh_, others by _rg_,
and others by _gh_; but as the sound of the _r_ ought to be almost
imperceptible, I have thought it better to employ, in rendering the
‎غ‎, the _G_ alone or the two letters _GH_.

47. The ف‎ answers exactly to _F_.

48. The ق‎ indicates a sound very nearly like that of the French
_K_, but it ought to be formed in the throat, and it is very
difficult to imitate it well. Many Arabs, those of Muscat, for
example, confound the pronunciation of this letter with that of غ‎,
and this pronunciation is common in the states of Marocco. In a
great part of Egypt, the ق‎ is only a strong and quick aspiration,
and it appears that this sound, very difficult to imitate, was the
distinctive characteristic of the Arabs descended from Modhar.

49. The ك‎ also answers to _K_, but it is not pronounced from the
throat as the preceding letter. The Turks and many of the Arabs give
it a softened pronunciation, analogous to that of _q_ in the French
words _queue_, _qui_; and it may be rendered by putting an _i_ after
_k_. Some Arabs pronounce the ك‎ and the ق‎ as an Italian _c_
before _i_, as in the word _cio_, a sound expressed in French by the
letters _tch_.

50. The ل‎ is perfectly rendered by _L_, and the م‎ by _M_.

51. The ن‎ is susceptible, according to the Arab grammarians, of
many pronunciations. When it is followed by a vowel, it is pronounced
always as _N_ in the French word _navire_, but when it is followed
immediately by another consonant the pronunciation varies.

52. The و‎ is pronounced as _OU_ in French, in the words _oui_,
_ouate_. It can also be rendered by _W_ pronounced in the manner of
the English. The Turks and Persians pronounce it as the French _V_.

53. The ه‎ represents only a very light and often insensible
aspiration, as the _h_ in the French words la _Hollande_, la
_Hongrie_, or it indicates only a simple hiatus.

54. The ى‎ ought to be pronounced as a _Y_ consonant, as in the
English word _yacht_. The Germans render it by _j_, as in the words
_bejahen_, _jagd_.

55. The لا‎ finds a place in the alphabet only because the two
letters ل‎ and ا‎, of which it is composed, take, in their
junction, a form which sometimes renders them unrecognizable.


_The Vowels._

64. The Arabs have only three signs to indicate all the sounds.
The first, named _fatha_, is formed like an acute accent, and is
placed above the consonant with which it forms an articulate sound,
as, كَتَبَ‎ _cataba_. The sound expressed by the _fatha_ answers
sometimes to the French _a_ more or less open, sometimes to _è_ or
_ai_, as in the words _succès_, _faire_.

The second is called _kesra_. It is formed similar to the preceding,
but is placed beneath the consonant with which it forms an articulate
sound, as in the word نِمْرِ‎ _nimri_. The sound of the _kesra_
answers sometimes to the French _i_, sometimes to _é_.

The third, called _dhamma_, has very nearly the form of our figure
9, sometimes it resembles our (,), and is always placed above the
consonant with which it forms an articulate sound, as, كُلُّ‎
_coullou_. The sound of _dhamma_ answers sometimes to the French _o_,
sometimes to _ou_ or _eu_.

68. The letters و‎, ا‎, and ى‎ often serve only to prolong the
sound of the vowel which precedes them.

74. Besides the three vowel signs before spoken of, the Arabs have
three other signs to which they give the name of _tenwin_, which
indicates that the vowel ought to be followed with the articulation
of a ن‎. Our grammarians call them _nunnations_; I shall call them
_nasal vowels_. These nasal vowels are only placed at the end of
words, and they serve to form some grammatical inflexions. Their
signs are nothing but the figure of the analogous vowel redoubled;
as, for example, بَابٌ‎ _bâbon_, بَابٍ‎ _bâbin_ بَابً‎ _bâban_.
These examples show at the same time the form of the three nasal
vowels and their pronunciation. The nasal vowel _an_ ought always to
be followed by an ا‎, as يَوْمًا‎ _yauman_, except when it is found
over a ة‎, as in حِكْمَةً‎ _hicmètan_, or followed by a ي‎ mute,
as هُدًي‎, or placed over a _hamza_, as شَيْئً‎: in the last case
the _elif_ is often preserved after the _tenwin_, and it is written
‎شَيْأً‎. The ن‎ contained in these nasal vowels, in pronunciation,
is subject to the same variations as the ن‎ consonant, and these
variations are indicated in the same manner.

77. In a great number of Coufic manuscripts the three vowels are
indicated by a very large point, painted ordinarily in red. Placed
above the letter it indicates the _fatha_; placed below, it indicates
the _kesra_, and placed in the body of the letter or at the end, or
in a line with the writing, it indicates the _dhamma_. In order to
indicate the nasal vowels, this point is doubled.

78. In African manuscripts the _fatha_ and the _kesra_, instead of
being inclined as our acute accent, are placed horizontally above or
below the consonant to which they belong.


_Of Orthographical Signs._

89. The _djesma_ is so called, because it separates the artificial
syllable at the end of which it is found, from the syllable
succeeding. Its name signifies _separation_. It is placed above the
letter, and is formed thus ( ْ ‎), as in the word أُقْعُدْ‎ _ok-od_.

The _djesma_ may be considered as the sign of a very short vowel; it
answers to the quiescent _sheva_ of Hebrew grammarians, and also to
their other short vowels, such as _hatèf-patah_, _hatèf-ségol_, &c.,
and to the sixth vowel of the Ethiopic alphabet.

107. When a consonant ought to be doubled in pronunciation, without
the interposition of a written vowel, the Arabs do not double the
figure of the letter, but they employ a sign named _teschdid_, formed
thus ( ّ ‎). This mark is placed above the letter which ought to be
doubled. Among the Arabs of Africa it is generally formed thus ([#]),
or thus ([#]), and is placed above or below the letter, as the vowel
which accompanies it. The figure of the _teschdid_ is a little ش‎,
abbreviated from the word شَدِيدٌ‎ _strong_, or of the word شِدّةٌ‎
_strength_, which is the name that the Africans give it.

124. Every ا‎ which is moved by a vowel, or which is moveable by
nature, although it may become djesmaed by certain grammatical rules,
is marked by a sign named _hamza_. This sign is formed thus (ء‎).
The _hamza_ or _elif_ hamzaed is a real articulation, of which the
value has been indicated already, and differs essentially from the
_elif_ not hamzaed, which is never moved by any vowel, and only
enters into words as a letter of prolongation or as a mute letter. If
the _elif_ is moved by a _kesra_, the _hamza_ is placed below the
letter, and the _kesra_ below the _hamza_, as, إِضْرَبْ‎.

130. A word which commences by a أ‎ hamzaed ought often to be
joined to the word which precedes it; and this union is indicated
by a sign named _wesla_, that is, _junction_; it is formed thus
‎(ٱ‎), and is placed above the _elif_. When this union takes place,
the _elif_ is always followed by a letter djesmaed, and then it is
pronounced as a compound syllable, with the last one of the preceding
word.

144. When the _elif_ of prolongation is followed immediately by
an ا‎ mute, instead of the last of these two ا‎, the _hamza_
only is written with its corresponding vowel, and over the ا‎ of
prolongation is placed a sign which is formed thus (ۤ‎), and which
is called _medda_ or _matta_, that is, _prolongation_.

146. The same sign is placed also over the letters, when they are
employed as figures, or as abbreviations instead of entire words.


_Of Punctuation and Abbreviations._

168. The Arabs generally do not employ any mark to indicate the
pauses, whether at the end of a period, or in the course of the
sentence. They only indicate the end of a subject, either by a red
point, or by one of these marks ۬‎, ؞‎, ۞‎, or by writing in red
the word which commences a new article, or by prolonging one of the
letters of the first word, as وَفِيـــــها‎. These different methods
of indicating the commencement of a new article answer to our fresh
paragraphs (_alinéa_).

169. If, in common manuscripts, no mark of punctuation is made use
of, these signs, on the contrary, are multiplied in manuscripts of
the Kurán. The end of each verse is there indicated by the figure ؞;
after each tenth verse, another sign is employed, which resembles the
‎ن‎ isolated, but entirely closed. These two signs mark rather the
division of verses, founded in general upon the rhyme, than serve
to distinguish the places where the reader ought to pause, in order
to render more intelligible the sense of his discourse. The true
signs of punctuation are the little letters written in red ink in
the superior interlineation. The م‎ indicates a pause, necessary to
avoid ambiguity: it is abridged from the word لاَزِمٌ‎ _necessary_.
The ط‎, contracted from the word مُطْلَقٌ‎, that is, _universal_,
shows a pause universally received by the readers of the Kurán.
The ج‎, contracted from the word جَآئِزٌ‎ _permitted_, shows a
pause left to the will of the reader. The ز, contracted from the
word مُجَوَّزٌ‎, _allowed_, indicates a pause permitted, but not
becoming. The ص‎, contracted from the word مُرَخَّصٌ‎ _admissible_,
marks a slight pause granted only from necessity, in order that the
reader may draw breath. When the sense requires that there should
be no pause at the end of a verse, it is indicated by the word لا‎
_not_, written above the last word of the verse, and of which the
meaning is لاَوَقْفَ‎ _there is no pause here_. The ق‎, contracted
from the word قِيلَ‎ _they say_, marks a contested pause. Lastly the
letters قفه‎, which represent the words وَقْفَةٌ يَسِرَةٌ‎, are the
sign of an extremely slight pause.

Among the great number of marks of punctuation peculiar to the Kurán,
the most necessary and the most used are the ط‎, the ج‎ and the
word لا‎.

171. Abbreviations are sometimes indicated by a figure similar to a
_medda_, and often they are marked by no particular sign.


_Of Figures or Signs of Numeration._

The eighth column of the alphabet shows the value which the
Arabs attach to their letters when they are employed as signs of
numeration. Of these letters, which are twenty-eight in number, nine
indicate the units, nine the tens, nine the hundreds, and one the
number 1000. The order according to which these letters are placed,
when considered as numerical signs, is that of the _aboudjed_. The
last six letters being, as there is every reason to believe, of a
much later invention than the rest of the alphabet, it is probable
that the Arabs, before they made use of these letters, indicated
the hundreds from 400 to 900 inclusive, in the same manner as the
Hebrews, whose alphabet consists only of twenty-two letters. If they
wished to express, for example, the number 600, they would join
together the ت‎, which is equivalent to 400, and the ر‎, which is
equivalent to 200. In order to express 900, they would join two ت‎,
equal together to 800, to ق‎ = 100.

The letters employed as figures follow the same direction as the
writing, from right to left, as, ‎قلب‎ 132, ‎غنج‎ 1053‎.

174. It is unnecessary to observe that in this system of numeration
there is no figure which answers to our cipher (0); it is absolutely
useless, as the value of each figure does not depend on its position
in relation to those which precede or follow it.

175. The _aboudjed_ of the Africans differing in some degree from
that of the Asiatics, there is also some difference in the value
which they attach to certain letters as signs of numeration. This
difference consists in that among them the ص‎ is equal to 60, the
‎ض‎ 90, the س‎ 300, the ظ‎ 800, the غ‎ 900, and the ش‎ 1000.

176. The Arabs have also another mode of numeration, from which
is derived those figures which we call _Arabic_; they call it the
_Indian cipher_ رَقَمٌ هِنْدِيٌّ‎. It is composed of the ten figures
following:

‎  ‎١‎   ٢‎   ٣‎   ٤‎   ٥‎   ٦‎   ٧‎   ٨‎   ٩‎   ٠‎
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0

The 5 is often formed thus [#], and the 0 like our own. When the
Arabs make use of this cipher, they follow a direction quite contrary
to that of their writing, and proceed from left to right. This
singularity is sufficient to prove that this cipher is not originally
Arabic.

ARMENIAN.

“The Armenians had no characters peculiar to themselves until the
fourth century, but they used indifferently those of the Syrians,
of the Persians, of the Arabians, and of the Greeks. The present
Armenian Alphabet contains thirty-eight letters, which they say were
invented by one Mesrop or Miesrob, minister of state, and secretary
to Warasdates, and Arsaces IV. kings of Armenia. Some authors affirm,
that this Mesrop afterwards became a hermit, and corresponded with
St. Chrysostom, who lived in the fourth century; though Angelus
Roccha, in his discourse on the books in the Vatican library,
George, patriarch of Alexandria, and Sixtus Senensis, assert, that
St. Chrysostom was the inventor of the Armenian characters, in whose
time the Bible was translated into the Armenian language, from the
Greek Septuagint, by some of their doctors who had learned the Greek
language, and amongst others by one Moses the grammarian, and David
the philosopher. Although the Armenian characters are generally
supposed to have been derived from the Greek, their forms are very
different, and their number exceeds those in the Greek alphabet,
by more than one third. The powers of the Armenian letters are
peculiarly adapted to the notation of that language, which is very
unpolished, and consequently very unlike the Greek. This alphabet
contains several letters or marks for sounds which frequently occur
in the Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and Armenian languages, but are not
found in the Greek.

“The Armenians have four kinds of writing: The first is called
_Zakghachir_, or flourished, used for the titles of books, and for
the beginning of chapters.

“The _second_ is called _Erghathachir_, _writing with iron_, or with
a _Stylus_, which has long been disused.

“The _third_ is called _Poloverchir_, or round, which is found in
their fairest MSS.

“The _fourth_ is called _Notrchir_, or running hand, which is used
for the ordinary affairs of life. The names and powers of the
Armenian letters are as follow:

“The Armenians say that _Haik_, who lived before the destruction
of Babel, was the first who spoke the Haikanian or Armenian
language.”--_Astle._

AUTHORS’ NAMES. _See_ BOTANICAL AUTHORITIES. LAW AUTHORITIES. ORGANIC
REMAINS.


AUTHOR’S PROOF.

After the errors of workmanship have been put to rights, a clean
proof is printed and sent to the author or editor, who makes on it
such alterations and amendments as he may think proper. This is
called an Author’s Proof; and the compositor is paid for the time
occupied in making these alterations in the types.




B.


BACK BOXES.

In cases for Italic where there are no small capitals, also in Old
English, and similar founts, the boxes in the upper case, that are
appropriated to small capitals in Roman letter, are styled _Back
Boxes_, and serve to lay two-line Capitals in, and other irregular
sorts.


BACK OF A COMPOSING STICK.

That part on which the bottom of the types rests.--_M._


BACKS.

In a form of bookwork, the backs are those pieces of furniture
placed between the sides of the pages and the cross of the chase, in
quartos, octavos, and duodecimos; and, when a sheet is folded, form,
except in quartos, the margin of part of the fore edge of a book.
_See_ IMPOSING. MARGIN.


BACKSIDE OF THE FORM,

is the under side that touches upon the correcting stone or press
stone.--_M._


BACK STAY.

A piece of girth or leather fastened to the lower hind rail at
one end and to the top rim of the coffin at the other, in wooden
presses, to check the running out of the carriage beyond the point
which will allow the tympan to rise clear of the front of the platen.


BAD COPY.

Such copy as is ill written, or has much Italick, Latin, or Greek,
or marginal notes, or few breaks, &c.--_M._ The term is now used
only of manuscript that is badly written, and the words or the sense
difficult to make out, with many interlineations. When this is the
case, it is usual to pay something extra per sheet. For Greek, and
marginal notes, an extra sum is always given, as may be seen in the
Scale of Prices.


BAD REGISTER. _See_ OUT OF REGISTER.


BAD WORK.

Any fault at the case or press, is in workmen’s language called _Bad
Work_.--_M._ We now call it _Bad Workmanship_; and by the term _Bad
Work_ is understood solid matter; that is, not leaded; with long
paragraphs; no white lines nor branching out; no short pages; nor
any white pages; such work is also called _A Solid Dig_; any other
work is also called _Bad Work_, that is tedious in the execution, or
difficult to perform, and does not fetch the workman a remunerating
price.


BAKE.

When the compositor lays up a form to clear it away, after a work
is finished, if he does not rinse the letter as well as if it were
rinsed for present use, or rather better, the ink that is dissolved
among the lye would, with long standing by, harden between the
letter, and make the letter stick so fast together that when it comes
afterwards to be distributed, the compositor cannot without great
difficulty and trouble get them asunder. This sticking together of
the letter is called _Baking of the Letter_. And compositors in this
case say _The Letter is Baked_.--_M._ This is the case particularly
with new letter, if it be not distributed almost as soon as worked
off; for if it be afterwards allowed to remain some time locked up
in the chase, it is very difficult to separate and distribute, and
causes great loss of time, and injury to the letter.

The usual remedy for this inconvenience is to pour boiling water
on the pages repeatedly, which tends to make the letters separate
more readily; but still the compositor has to press them against
the edge of his case, which makes the ends of his fingers sore, and
when he cannot accomplish it in this way, he not unfrequently must
have recourse to his teeth. Soaking the new letter in soap and water
before it is used, is said to be the best remedy.


BALDWIN, ELIZABETH. _See_ DONATIONS.


BALL KNIFE.

An old blunt-edged knife, that pressmen lay by, to scrape their balls
with.--_M._ It is generally an old table knife; but a sharp-edged one
is better than a blunt one, if it be carefully used. The use of the
Ball Knife is now nearly superseded by the adoption of composition
rollers.


BALL LEATHERS.

The exterior coverings of the balls, made either of pelts, of tanned
sheep’s skins.--_M._ Ball Leathers, dressed with oil, were introduced
within the author’s recollection; but, although more durable, and
sweeter in use than pelts, they were not adapted to produce fine
work, and were therefore soon discontinued.


BALL LININGS.

When balls are made of pelts, the wool in the first instance is
covered with the pelt of an old ball, previously soaked in the pelt
pot and well scraped; this is again covered with a new pelt, and
nailed to the ball stock, which makes the ball complete. The old pelt
is called the _Ball Lining_, and makes it firmer in the neck, and
also wear longer.


BALL NAILS.

The nails that ball leathers are tacked to the ball stocks with.--_M._


BALL NECK.

That part of the ball which is immediately between the stock and the
body of the wool, just below the nails, is named the _Ball Neck_, or
the _Neck of the Ball_.


[Illustration: Rack for the printing balls]

BALL RACK.

Two round tapering wooden pins fastened into a feather-edged piece of
elm, and nailed to the near cheek of the press, in which to place the
balls when they are not in use, nearly on a level with the ink block.
There is frequently an additional one, for two balls, nailed higher
up to the same cheek, under the cap, for a pair of spare balls, or to
keep them separate when necessary; pelt balls injure each other when
kept together for any length of time; and composition balls should
never be left one upon the other, for they adhere to each other, and
the surface is frequently torn in separating them.

Moveable ball racks are sometimes used for convenience, with the rack
fastened to an upright piece of wood, fixed into a cross piece to
serve it for standing upon.


BALLS.

Two circular pieces of pelt, leather, or canvass covered with
composition, stuffed with wool and nailed to the ball stocks, used
to cover the surface of the article to be printed with ink, in order
to obtain an impression from it. Moxon says they were occasionally
stuffed with hair; and that if the ball stocks were six inches in
diameter the ball leathers were cut about nine inches and a half
diameter. They are made larger, according to the work they are
required for; those used for Newspapers were the largest.

Pelt Balls are superseded in London by composition Balls and
composition rollers, and nearly so in the country; but when I
recollect that the most splendidly printed English books were
executed with pelt Balls, and that a printer may be so situated in
the country, or in some foreign place, as not to be able to procure
composition Balls or rollers, I think it useful to give directions
how to make and manage Balls of pelts, so that wherever a printer
may be situated, he may sustain no great inconvenience, provided he
has a skin at his command: and I shall in the first place give an old
Pressman’s directions for this purpose, who was well and practically
experienced in every variety of presswork, and who wrote them
expressly for this work.

“The pelt being well soaked, the pressman scrapes with the ball
knife a little of the wet and filth off--twists it--puts it on the
currying-iron, holding an end in each hand, and curries it, by
pulling it strongly backwards and forwards, till it becomes warm and
pliable, and the grease adheres to his hands, so that the pelt is in
danger of slipping out of them while currying: without treading he
cuts the pelt into two equal parts, across, and scrapes both sides
of them; he then lays one of them on a press stone, or on any other
stone that is large enough, and stretches it and spreads it well with
the grain side downwards: the pelt of an old ball being well soaked,
he cleans it, scraping it partially, so that some of the moisture
may remain in it, and spreads it on the new pelt, as a lining, but
does not stretch it nearly so much as the new one, and then nails an
edge of them to the ball stock: the wool, being previously carded or
combed, he lays in single locks one upon another, crossways, till he
has enough for the size of the Ball which he is making. If it be for
a newspaper it must be very large; if for bookwork, to be used with
common ink, it must be smaller in proportion; but in both cases he
brings the ends of the locks of wool into one hand, forming it into
the shape of a ball very slightly, and puts these ends into the bowl
of the stock; then bringing the opposite edge of the pelt to that
already nailed, he also nails that to the ball stock; then he nails
two other parts of the pelt opposite to each other, between those
parts before nailed; then he plaits the pelt, nailing it regularly on
the ball stocks; and cuts off the superfluous edges of the skin. The
linings ought to be large enough to be nailed to the ball stock equal
with the skin. Then he makes another ball, exactly the same as the
first; and if both have a full even face, with no hillocks or dales,
he has got a pair of good Balls.

“After having knocked up his Balls, he washes both them and the
stocks well, and lets them lie out of the water a quarter of an hour;
then placing one edge of the face upon the edge of the bank, the
coffin of the press, or upon any other convenient place, and the end
of the ball stock against his breast, he takes the handle of a sharp
table knife in one hand and the end of the blade in the other, and
scrapes it regularly and rather strongly from the plaits to the face
of the Ball, at every scrape turning round the Ball, which brings
out such a quantity of grease and moisture, as obliges him at the
first to wipe his knife at every scrape; he thus proceeds, till he
can scarcely bring any more out of the skin. He then places a sheet
or sheets of paper on the face of the Ball, and rubs it well with his
hands, till the Ball is thoroughly dry, his companion doing the same
to the other Ball: they then begin to work the form.

“If a pressman has to execute fine work with strong ink, he stuffs
the Balls harder with wool than he does for weak ink; because strong
ink lugs or stretches the skin very fast, and soon slackens the
Balls, if not hard stuffed.

“I was several years employed on fine work and strong ink, in an
office where it was not allowed to tread a skin; this circumstance
caused me to try the above-mentioned plan, and experience has taught
me that it is by far the most preferable method.

“I also know by experience that a greasy skin is the best for strong
ink, if treated in this manner; because it always keeps mellow until
the balls are worn out, and there is less trouble in capping them.

“Making Balls is a nasty job: there is an old proverb in the trade,
that ‘_The devil would have been a pressman, if there were no Balls
to make_;’ that is, the printer’s devil.” _See_ PELTS.

Tanned sheep’s skins, dressed with oil, have been used, to avoid
smell, and for durability: they were more durable than pelts; but
they were not calculated for producing fine impressions, not being
soft; and, in consequence, not retaining dirt or other extraneous
matter on their surface; this occasioned picks, and rendered them
unsuitable for printing small letter or fine engravings with neatness.

When the pressmen leave work at night, the pelt balls are capped;
that is, they are wrapped up, each in a blanket steeped in urine; and
this is always done when they are not in use: it keeps them soft,
and in working condition; but they are to be scraped, and dried with
paper, to get rid of the moisture, each time they are wanted. There
have been many attempts to supersede the use of urine, on account of
its disagreeableness and smell; but no substitute, to my knowledge,
has answered the purpose so well with pelts.

Composition Balls and composition rollers have, as I previously
observed, superseded the use of pelt balls in the metropolis, and
nearly so in the country. This has arisen from their superior
cleanliness and sweetness, and being equal to pelts in producing
good work. They can also be procured, generally, at the moment they
are wanted, in the best working state; since their introduction the
manufacture of them has become a new business, and they are supplied
at so moderate a rate, (either per week or quarter,) and may be
renewed as often as required, that scarcely a printing office in
London at the present day troubles itself to make Balls; and hence no
pressman need ever complain of having bad Balls as an excuse for bad
workmanship.

These Balls will be found peculiarly convenient in small offices,
where even one press is not in constant employment; for they may be
kept for any length of time without injury to them; and if they be
preserved in a proper temperament, will be always ready for use at
the moment required. If they should become a little too dry, they may
be restored to a proper state for working in a very short time by
sponging them over with water, and distributing them; or, if there
be time, by placing them in a damp situation, in order that they may
imbibe moisture.

They may be easily made in an office at a distance from town, where
it may be both inconvenient and expensive to have them removed
backwards and forwards, by having a shallow dish formed of tin, &c.
pouring the melted composition in it, and before it is cold attaching
a piece of canvass to it sufficiently large to form a Ball of the
size wanted. The facing will be thus thicker in the middle and taper
off to the edge, which will be quite thin; and the edge of the
composition should be continued well over the rounding of the Ball,
to prevent it ever touching the form in beating, and thus avoiding
any ill effects from portions of ink or dirt that would lodge at the
extremity of the composition, and come in contact with the types or
engraving. _See_ COMPOSITION.


[Illustration: A tool to hold an inked ball]

BALL STOCKS.

Turned of Alder or Maple. They are about seven inches in diameter,
and have their under side turned hollow, to contain the greater
quantity of wool or hair, to keep the ball leathers plump the
longer.--_M._ They are now made of Elm, and the handles are Beech:
but an improvement has been made in this article of late years,
although it has not been generally adopted, viz. turning the bowl
and handle in one piece, instead of having the handle fitted into
the bowl, which frequently came loose, and was troublesome to the
Pressman, often catching the skin of his hand, and pinching it. The
usual size of the bowl for bookwork, is five inches and a quarter in
diameter.


BANK.

A deal table, on which the Pressmen have the paper when printing.
It was called a Horse in Moxon’s time. _See_ HORSE. It is useful to
have a small drawer in the front of it, in which the Pressmen may put
their thin paper for overlays, their paste points, and many other
articles that would otherwise be lying upon the shelf or platen.


BANK NOTES.

On the 13th of January, 1819, Mr. James Fergusson, of Newman Street,
Oxford Street, printer, sent to the Commissioners for inquiring into
the Prevention of Forgery of Bank Notes, his plan for that purpose,
of which the following is his published description.

“My plan is reared upon the solid foundation of putting it in the
power of every individual to be _certain_ whether a Bank-note is
genuine or spurious _by inspection_. I propose, in order to form
the ground-work of Bank-notes, to cast a fount, or several founts,
of types, formed of such a peculiar shape, that, when printed from,
the impression would appear, at first sight, like a line engraving;
while, at the same time, when examined more closely, every part of
it might be easily read. Although it is not in my power, without
going to considerable expence, to produce a specimen of such types
as ought to be made for this purpose, yet no one will deny that
they may be obtained by means of punch-cutters and letter-founders.
This being granted, let me suppose that I have got such types; I
should then proceed to compose a page with them of the size of
a Bank-note, consisting of such subject-matter as may be deemed
advisable,--probably, an explanation of the way by which forgery
could be detected. From this page of moveable types, I should make a
stereotype plate; and I should then, by stamping or engraving upon
the stereotype plate, put the promissory words of the Bank-note,
with the addition of whatever ornamental lines might be thought
proper. This stereotype plate, so formed, would give, by one pull at
the letter-press, a completed Bank-note, unless it might be deemed
requisite to add the numbering; and a signature or signatures, in
writing. Having got _one_ stereotype plate in the way I describe, I
should use it for no other purpose than to obtain others; and from
them I could easily make plates to any amount that may be necessary,
all which would yield impressions obviously alike. As the promissory
and ornamental parts of the note, _in white_, will purposely be
made to intersect the words printed _in black_ all over the surface
of the note, the intersections will prove an _infallible_ guide to
distinguish a spurious note from a genuine one. This contrivance
of intersections being the leading feature in my plan, I have
denominated it _The Intersection Plan_.

“Individuals, when familiarized to notes issued upon this principle,
would naturally select some portion to which they might easily refer,
to ascertain the genuineness of a note. And, for further security, if
necessary, the Bank might print what I may call _Standards_, for the
use of the public, to be sold for a trifle, merely to insure their
preservation. The Standards to be printed from the same plates as the
notes themselves, but on paper quite of another texture and colour
from the note paper, for the purpose of proving the correctness of
the intersections.” _See_ FORGERY.

BASKET.

In printing offices where there are large founts of letter, and the
fount cases of any particular fount are not sufficient to hold the
superfluous sorts, the surplus is put in coffins, and deposited in
round baskets, till wanted.


BATTER.

When the face of any letters gets injured in a form, it is termed a
Batter.

This accident frequently occurs:--in the course of working at press a
letter or letters will draw out in beating, and occasionally be left
on the form without being perceived; this, when the next impression
is pulled, injures the page on which it was left;--a pin, needle,
or bodkin, used as pickers, will sometimes be laid on a page and
forgot--and other small articles, which produce the same injury.
It also happens with forms reared up at the ends of frames, where
the faces of the letter in the forms are put to each other, with a
quoin, or a piece of furniture, to prevent them touching, which being
accidentally displaced, the letter gets injured. The only thing to
be done when these accidents occur, is to replace the letters; this
however is too frequently done without showing a revise to the Reader
or Overseer; and thus errors creep into a work, which no care on the
part of a Reader can prevent. To steady careful men these accidents
seldom happen; and they ought to be guarded against, in as much as
they cause loss of time to the workmen, and expense of materials to
the master printer; and when letters or words must be replaced, the
work should never be proceeded with at press, previously to its being
examined.

When a fine engraving on wood is at press, the workman should be most
particularly careful, as an accident might thus spoil an expensive
work of art, which it might be impossible to replace.

When a Batter unfortunately happens at press in working stereotype
plates, it is too frequently overlooked by the pressmen, and the work
proceeds in a deteriorated state; while, generally speaking, if the
same accident had happened to a form of moveable types it would have
been set right. The reason is, that while in the latter case the
accident could be remedied in a few minutes, the stereotype plate
on the other hand would have to be taken out of the form and sent
to the founders, and would not be repaired in less than five or six
hours, during which time the pressmen would be unemployed, to their
loss. This is one cause that operates against the more general use of
stereotype plates.


BEARD OF A LETTER,

is the outer angle of the square shoulder of the shank, which reaches
almost up to the bottom of the face of the letter; and is commonly
scraped off by the Founder.--_M._


BEARER.

A piece of reglet pasted on the frisket to ease any particular part
in a form that has too much pressure on it from the platen of the
press.--_M._

Double Pica reglet is used for this purpose, as its thickness is
equal to the difference between the height of the types and the
furniture; and this application of it makes this sized reglet in
general a scarce article in a printing office.

Where any parts of the impression of a form come off hard, which from
various causes occasionally happens, particularly at the edges of the
pages, and at the foot of a short page, a bearer is applied to ease
that part; but some care however is required in its application--it
must not bear upon any printed matter at the back of it, for if it
does, it will smear and deface that part, nor is it necessary to
place it close to the part, but it may be put at some distance, and
if convenient near the outer edge of the paper, and made to rest on
the flat part of the furniture.

After selecting a piece of reglet of the proper length, paste one
side of it, and place it with the pasted side uppermost upon the
furniture where it is required, then turn down the tympans and
frisket and rub that part with the hand to make it adhere to the
frisket; or, as is usually done, after the form is beat, when the
next pull will make it adhere; if it be not quite sufficient, a
thickness or two of a wrapper pasted on it will ease the pull
sufficiently on that part.

_High Bearers_, are pieces of furniture made barely letter height;
they are used where separate wood cuts are printed, or very small
forms; they are placed on the press stone, usually pasted down, but
at such a distance from the printed matter that neither the balls nor
the rollers touch them in inking the form; they lighten the pressure
on the extremities, and tend to equalize the pull if the carriage be
not run in exactly to its place, by the platen bearing upon them.
If they be not sufficiently high, they may be added to by overlays
pasted upon them.


BEAT.

To cover the surface of the types with ink by means of the
balls.--_M._ _See_ FINE PRESSWORK.


BEAT FAT.

If a Pressman takes too much ink with his balls, he _beats fat_. The
black English faced letter is generally beaten fat.--_M._ At the
present day we understand by _Fat_ Beating, that a pressman beating
carefully, goes gradually two or three times over the form, so that
every part of the surface of the type is touched six or seven times
by the face of the balls; and is thus uniformly covered with a proper
quantity of ink.


BEAT LEAN.

Is to take but little ink, and often: all small letter must be beaten
lean.--_M._ This and the preceding term _Beat Fat_, have changed
their meaning since the days of Moxon; to beat lean now, is to beat
lightly, and quickly make a riddance of work, without much regard to
its quality.


BED.

To bed or lay the press stone in the coffin, so that it shall lie
firm and solid in all parts.--_M._ There are different ways of
bedding a press stone: some bed it in bran; some in plaster; but the
general way is with paper. To effect this the paper ought not to have
any large knots in it, and should be cut to the size of the coffin,
and if there be any inequalities in the bottom of the stone, there
must be additional pieces of paper placed under it to fill them up.
When it is supposed there is sufficient paper in the coffin to raise
the stone high enough, it is slung in on two pieces of cord, and a
trial made of its firmness; if it rocks, it is lifted out again, and
additional paper placed in those parts where the stone did not rest
firmly. When it is properly bedded, the ends of the cords are tucked
in at the sides of the stone so as to be easily picked out again with
a bodkin. When the stone has got to lie solid with working, the upper
side should be about a Brevier higher than the coffin.

Although I have mentioned cord, as being generally used for slinging
the stone into the coffin, and lifting it out again, yet strong flat
tape is decidedly superior; the stone lies more solid with it than
with cord, and is not so liable to break.

BENGALESE.

The following article is extracted from Nathaniel Brassey Halhed’s
Grammar of the Bengal Language.

“Exclusive of the Shanscrit, there are three different dialects
applied (tho’ not with equal currency) in the kingdom of Bengal: Viz.
the Persian, the Hindostanic and the proper Bengalese; each of which
has its own peculiar department in the business of the country,
and consequently neither of them can be universally adopted to the
exclusion of the others.

“What the pure Hindostanic is to upper India, the language which I
have here endeavoured to explain is to Bengal, intimately related
to the Shanscrit both in expressions, construction and character.
It is the sole channel of personal and epistolary communication
among the Hindoos of every occupation and tribe. All their business
is transacted, and all their accounts are kept in it; and as their
system of education is in general very confined, there are few among
them who can write or read any other idiom: the uneducated, or eight
parts in ten of the whole nation, are necessarily confined to the
usage of their mother tongue.

“The Shanscrit, or sacred language of Hindostan, from whence the
dialect of Bengal immediately proceeds, is supposed by its professors
to be the most antient and most excellent in the world. They assert
that it exceeds every other language in the number of its letters,
and esteem this excess as an incontrovertible argument of its
antiquity and superiority.

[Illustration: The Bengalese Alphabet]

“The Bengal Alphabet, like that of the Shanscrit, consists of FIFTY
letters, in the following order.

“_First Series._

  অ _o_     আ aa     ই _ee_    ঈ ee
  উ _oo_     ঊ oo     ঋ r_ee_   ৠ ree
  ঌ l_ee_    ৡ lree   এ a       ঐ i
  ও o        ঔ ou     অং ung    অঃ oh

“_Second Series_.

  ক k_o_     খ k,h_o_     গ g_o_     ঘ g,h_o_     ঙ ng_oo-o_
  চ ch_o_    ছ ch,h_o_    জ j_o_     ঝ j,h_o_     ঞ gn_ee-o_
  ট t_o_     ঠ t,h_o_     ড d_o_     ঢ d,h_o_      ণ aano
  ত t_o_     থ t,h_o_     দ d_o_     ধ d,h_o_      ন n_o_
  প p_o_     ফ p,h_o_     ব b_o_     ভ b,h_o_     ম m_o_
  য j_o_      র r_o_       ল l_o_     ব w_o_       --
  ষ sh_o_     ষ sh_o_      স s_o_     হ h_o_       ক্ষ khy-_o_

“It is to be observed, that in the Bengal alphabet, all the names of
the consonants commence with the respective consonants which they
denote; as _ko_, _go_, _jo_, &c. whereas in English, seven of them
are preceded by a vowel: _ef_, _el_, _em_, _en_, _ar_, _ess_, & _ex_.
It follows from hence, that the short vowel of the Bengalese is
invariably subjoined to the consonant with which it is uttered, and
never precedes: as ক and গ always stand for k_o_, and g_o_, and in no
case for _o_k, or _o_g.

“The vowels, as used in composition, when joined with consonants,
have a very different figure from those which are in the first series
of the alphabet. I shall here insert a table of the forms of vowels
in composition, corresponding to those which are initial or single.

“_A Table of the corresponding Vowels._

  অ _o_      ক k_o_ (the included vowel.)
  আ aa      কা kaa       এ a      কে ka
  ই _ee_     কি k_ee_     ঐ i      কৈ ki or k_o_-i
  ঈ ee       কী kee       ও o      কো ko
  উ _oo_     কু k_oo_     ঔ ou     কৌ kou
  ঊ oo       কূ koo       অং ung   কং kung
             অঃ _o_h     কঃ k_o_h

“By the original structure of this language every consonant
inherently possesses the short vowel on which its utterance depends;
it is plain therefore on this principle, that no two consonants could
have been joined together, and successively pronounced in the same
syllable, but that a vowel must necessarily have intervened. As an
expedient to remedy this inconvenience, a set of distinct characters
were invented, called ফলা P,h_o_laa, or adjuncts. They are certain
subordinate and subsidiary figures, that may be attached to each of
the consonants in the alphabet respectively, to provide against the
too frequent recurrence of the internal vowel.

“These _P,holaa_, are presented in a distinct series or alphabet,
consisting of eleven subservient marks or signs, for different
letters; which are here joined to ক k_o_, the first of the single
consonants, and which may, in the same manner, be applied to all the
other letters.

“The twelfth word of the series, (which seems to be added by the
Bengalese merely to fill up the rhythm) relates to another subject,
which will be explained in a subsequent remark.

“The reader must remember, that the letter র r_o_, in its proper
character, is never joined to any other letter or adjunct; but its
figure is entirely changed by a connection with other consonants, as
will be seen in the following series.

“_The twelve_ P,HOLAS.

  Figure.    Name.            Power.
  ক্য       ky-_o_           ky-_o_
  ক্র       k_o_r_o_         kr_o_
  ক্ন       k_o_n_o_         kn_o_
  ক্ল       k_o_l_o_         kl_o_
  ক্ব       koo-_o_          kw_o_, or sometimes koo.

  ষ্ক       ashk_o_          shk_o_
  সিদ্ধি     sh_ee_dd,h_ee_    ----

“The compound letters may be formed by three methods: either by
placing one letter immediately under another, or by blending two
letters together, so as to make one character from their union; or by
making the first of the two consonants much smaller than the other
letters. This last mode seems to be the most common.

“সিদ্ধি sh_ee_dd,h_ee_, called the twelfth _P,holaa_, is a word
always prefixed to the class of vowels contained in the first Series
of the alphabet. _Sheedd,hee_ is part of a Shanscrit sentence, which
means _be it properly performed_; and as these words are usually
prefixed to the class of vowels, that Series has obtained the name of
_sheedd,hee_.

“_The Series_ Sh_ee_d,h_ee_.

  o          ou       ung       oh

অ _o_, is always an initial letter.

আ aa, is also initial.

“I shall set down a few of the most common contractions of letters
which are constantly used by all the Bengalese, as being more
expeditious, as well as more elegant than a simple junction of the
single letters, whose office they perform.

ক্র kr_o_, stands for ক্র the kirr_o_ _Pholaa_.

[#] _o_kt_o_, is ও to blended with ক k_o_; its regular form is [#].

কু k_oo_, stands for ক k_o_ with hr_o_sw_oo_kaar.

[#] ung_o_, is compounded of ঙ ng_oo_-_o_ with গ g_o_ subjoined.

[#] _o_ggy_o_, is another figure for the _Pholaa_ [#].

[#] m_oo_, is ম m_o_ and ব w_o_ compounded. The simple form is [#].

[#] _o_shn_o_, for [#] i. e. ণ aan_o_ subjoined to ষ sh_o_.

[#] sh_oo_, initial and medial, [#] sh_oo_, final; two figures for
[#].

[#] This figure stands for both [#] _o_tt_o_ and [#] t_oo_.

[#] g_oo_, is used for [#].

[#] h_oo_, stands for [#].

[#] _o_hr_o_, is kr_o_ _Pholaa_ subjoined to হ h_o_.

[#] tr_o_, stands for [#].

[#] roo, is used instead of [#].

[#] _o_hl_o_, is ল l_o_ subjoined to হ h_o_.

[#] _o_nd_o_, compounded of ণ aan_o_ and ড d_o_.

[#] _o_hj_o_, is হ h_o_ and জ j_o_ blended together.

[#] _o_hm_o_, a compound of হ h_o_ and ম m_o_.

[#] _o_st_oo_, is স s_o_ and ট t_o_, with hr_o_sw_oo_kaar subjoined.

[#] _o_str_o_, is the letter স s_o_ compounded with ট t_o_, and the
kr_o_ _Pholaa_.

[#] j_oo_, stands for [#].

[#] _o_gd,h_o_, [#] _o_dd,h_o_, [#] _o_nd,h_o_, represent ধ d,h_o_
severally subjoined to গ g_o_, দ d_o_, and ন n_o_.

[#] this figure is called _o_rdd,h_o_-t_o_, i. e. _semi-to_; for
_o_rdd,h_o_ signifies _half_. It is used for the letter ত t_o_
without its internal vowel; and in the middle of a word is generally
represented by ২ the numerical figure of _two_.

[#] _o_ty_o_, is the preceding [#] blended with the _kyo pholaa_.

“I shall now proceed to a few marks of reference commonly used by the
Bengalese.

“[#] This figure is always put at the top of every writing, and is
meant as an invocation to G_o_nash, the Deity of Knowledge and Arts;
it is called G_o_nashar aak_o_r_ee_, or the crook of _Gonash_. So the
Mahometans always begin with the letter [#] _aleph_, as a token of
the unity of God.

“[#] Chaandb_oo_ndaa, is a mark put over certain letters to give them
a very forcible nasal expression.

“৺ Eeshw_o_r, is properly one of the deities of the Hindoo Trinity.
The name of God was supposed too holy to be inserted among the
general class of words, and was therefore written at the top of
the page, and wherever this name should occur in a sentence, the
mark here specified was put as a reference to it. The form still
remains, but the usage is degraded into a mere compliment: for in
all petitions, or letters from inferiors to their superiors, the
name of the person addressed is now put at the top, and this sign of
reference occupies the place in the body of the letter, where the
name should regularly have been inserted.

“[#] Sree properly signifies prosperity, and is prefixed to every
name which they mean to mention with respect; as sree sree Raam, sree
sree G_o_nash.

“One or more of these titles of Hindoo deities is first written on
every piece of paper, as an amulet or charm, before any letter,
petition or other writing whatever, is committed to it. In the same
manner the Mahometans universally apply their _Bismillah_ (or, _In
the name of God_.) as we formerly wrote _Emanuel_ at the top of
letters, and still continue to commence a ledger with LAUS DEO.

“The denominations of the cardinal numbers are so irregular in
Bengalese, that I find it will be necessary to exhibit them as far
as one hundred. And it must be observed as a particularity, that the
ninth numeral of every series of ten, is not specified by the term of
nine in the common order of progression, but takes its appellation
from the series immediately above; as for instance the number _twenty
nine_ is not expressed by _nobeesh_, which should seem the proper
denomination, but is called _oonteesh_, or one less than thirty. So
_thirty nine_ is _oonchaa-leesh_, or one less than forty.

In respect to the Bengalese types with which Halhed’s grammar is
printed, he thus observes, “The public curiosity must be strongly
excited by the beautiful characters which are displayed in the
following work: and although my attempt may be deemed incompleat or
unworthy of notice, the book itself will always bear an intrinsic
value, from its containing as extraordinary an instance of mechanic
abilities as has perhaps ever appeared. That the Bengal letter is
very difficult to be imitated in steel will readily be allowed by
every person who shall examine the intricacies of the strokes,
the unequal length and size of the characters, and the variety of
their positions and combinations. It was no easy task to procure
a writer accurate enough to prepare an alphabet of a similar and
proportionate body throughout, and with that symmetrical exactness
which is necessary to the regularity and neatness of a fount.
Mr. Bolts (who is supposed to be well versed in this language)
attempted to fabricate a set of types for it, with the assistance
of the ablest artists in London. But as he egregiously failed in
executing even the easiest part, or primary alphabet, of which he
has published a specimen, there is no reason to suppose that his
project, when compleated, would have advanced beyond the usual state
of imperfection to which new inventions are constantly exposed.

“The advice and even sollicitation of the Governor General prevailed
upon Mr. Wilkins, a gentleman who has been some years in the India
Company’s civil service in Bengal, to undertake a set of Bengal
types. He did, and his success has exceeded every expectation. In a
country so remote from all connexion with European artists, he has
been obliged to charge himself with all the various occupations of
the Metallurgist, the Engraver, the Founder, and the Printer. To
the merit of invention he was compelled to add the application of
personal labour. With a rapidity unknown in Europe, he surmounted
all the obstacles which necessarily clog the first rudiments of a
difficult art, as well as the disadvantages of solitary experiment;
and has thus singly on the first effort exhibited his work in a
state of perfection which in every part of the world has appeared
to require the united improvements of different projectors, and the
gradual polish of successive ages.”

The gentleman here spoken of was Charles Wilkins, Esq., a descendant
of the learned Bishop Wilkins, and one of the founders of the Asiatic
Society. He was afterwards created Doctor of Laws, and appointed
Librarian to the East-India Company at their establishment in
Leadenhall Street. He was reputed to be the best Shanscrit scholar in
Europe.


BENVENUE.

Half a crown paid by a new workman to the Chapel when he commences,
which is always spent. If a journeyman wrought formerly in the same
printing house, and comes again to work in it, he pays but half a
benvenue. If a journeyman smout more or less on another printing
house, he pays half a benvenue.--_M._ _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

This custom is still retained in printing offices, and the amount
generally paid is the same as it was in the seventeenth century,
though the value of half a crown then was considerably more than it
is now. Under particular circumstances the Chapel sometimes takes
less; and the workmen always add something each, so as to be able
to provide bread and cheese and a draught of porter to welcome the
new comer. The word is now pronounced _Bevénue_; it is evidently a
corruption of the Fr. _bien venu_ or _welcome_.


BIBLE ORTHOGRAPHY.

Many religious works are printed with numerous extracts from the Holy
Scriptures without any reference to the Book, Chapter, or Verse,
and as they are frequently made from memory, they are generally
inaccurate. I am clearly of opinion that wherever a quotation
is made, it should be given literally as it appears in the work
from which it is taken, otherwise it is worse than useless,--for
it misleads. With regard to extracts from the Bible, I hold it
indispensable that they should be given without the slightest
variation from the original; but as many words in the Bible vary in
their orthography from Johnson’s Dictionary, which is the book of
reference generally in use, and as the authorized editions of the
Scriptures differ in this respect from each other in many instances,
I have collated the King’s Printers, the Oxford, the Cambridge, and
the Edinburgh editions with Johnson’s Dictionary and with each other,
for the purpose of enabling the printer to preserve uniformity in
orthography with little trouble to himself in reprints of the Bible,
and in extracts occurring in religious works, according as the author
may prefer any of these editions.

These variations from each other do not extend to words but are
confined to the orthography, and to the difference of the same
expression being given in one word, in two words, or in being made a
compound word; thus in the Cambridge and the Edinburgh Bibles there
are a great number of compound words, while in the King’s Printers
and Oxford Bibles the same words are given either joined together as
one word or made into two words; and we find very few compound words,
except proper names. I have also given the Bible orthography where
Johnson gives two ways of spelling a word. The result will be seen in
the following Table; which also shows the variations, to a certain
degree, that have taken place in the language during the last two
hundred years.

The late Mr. Thomas Bensley, who was printer to the University
of Oxford, told me, about the year 1805, that they had a sealed
copy there, as a standard to read from; if this be the case, it is
difficult to account for their copies of late years having numerous
variations from the earlier editions. I think it very desirable that
there should be a standard edition that we could refer to, as a pure
text; and it would also be desirable to know on what authority these
variations are made in the holy Scriptures, for every word, every
point, nay every capital letter, I believe, was carefully considered
before it was adopted in the first edition of the authorized version
in 1611, and this too by a considerable number of the most learned
men of the kingdom, who had the direction of the work.

With regard to the words in the Bible printed in Italic characters,
Dr. Myles Smyth, one of the two appointed Revisers of the authorized
version, in the Preface to the first edition, published in 1611,
gives the following reason for their use:--

“Moreouer, whereas the necessitie of the sentence required any thing
to be added (for such is the grace and proprietie of the Ebrewe and
Greeke tongues that it cannot, but either by circumlocution, or by
adding the verbe or some word, be vnderstood of them that are not
well practised therein), wee haue put it in the text with an other
kinde of letter, that it may easily bee discerned from the common
letter.”

The Preface was written and affixed by the King’s command. The first
Edition of the Bible was printed in Black Letter, and the “other
kinde of letter” was roman; when the Black Letter was disused, and
the Roman character substituted, the “other kinde of letter” was
changed to Italic. Dr. Smyth was afterwards Bishop of Gloucester.

“The Hebrew word, which is in our English Bible rendered ‘The LORD,’
is in the Hebrew the High and Holy name of God himself, the most
solemn of all words--JEHOVAH. It is a general rule throughout the Old
Testament, that, wheresoever the word ‘LORD’ is printed in capital
letters, it will be found on looking into the Hebrew Bible, that the
word there written was JEHOVAH. And for this difference, between the
translation and the original work, the following reason is given.
The later Jews have a fancy that this name of JEHOVAH is so sacred
and aweful, that it could never be spoken, excepting by the High
Priest once in a year, without the sin of taking GOD’s name in vain.
And accordingly when, at this day, they read the Scriptures in their
Synagogues, whenever the word JEHOVAH is used, they say ADONAI, or
LORD, in its place. But the learned men, by whom our English Bible
was translated, had been instructed in Hebrew by the Jews; and were
so far moved by their example, as to feel the same anxiety, with
their teachers, to prevent this name from being commonly spoken.
Instead, therefore, of writing ‘JEHOVAH,’ they have written for the
most part ‘The LORD:’ but they have written it in capital letters
that the Lord of Heaven and Earth might be distinguished from all His
creatures.”--_Bishop Heber’s Sermons_, vol. ii.

England is the only Protestant country in Europe where the printing
of Bibles is a monopoly.

Bibles, _see_ PAPER.


BILL,

with letter founders, a specific proportionate number of types,
the datum from which the proportion is estimated being 3,000 lower
case ems. A bill of Pica weighs 800 pounds, including italic, which
is in the proportion of one tenth of the roman. The term “bill” is
not used among printers, although it is by the letter founders; this
would be styled by printers, a fount of Pica of eight hundred weight.

Smith is, as far as I am aware, the first writer who published the
number of each sort that the founders cast to 3,000 ems; and he also
made some alterations in the numbers previously cast by the letter
founders, “by enlarging the numbers of some sorts, and by lessening
the quantity of others,” “to try whether a fount of letter would turn
out more perfect than it sometimes does.”

Later writers have copied Smith’s numerical list of sorts, as well
as his altered numbers, and by copying his words without mentioning
his name each of them appears to the public as having suggested an
improvement, while, in fact, the founders pay no regard to these
proportions, but cast from a scale of their own.

The late Earl Stanhope gave another scale of numbers, produced by
counting the letters and points to a certain extent in Enfield’s
Speaker; but as he discarded the ligatures, and added what he called
“Logotypes,” his numbers are not followed.

I do not know on what datum the number of each letter was originally
obtained, as cast by the founders; but it is well known in practice
that a great number of imperfections are always wanted in a printing
office; and from the construction of language it appears there always
will be a great number of particular sorts deficient, whatever the
proportions may be at first. In proof of this it may be stated, that
a new fount of letter shall be cast for the purpose of printing a
work; in composing this letter it shall be found that there is a
great deficiency of some letters, and a superabundance of others: to
bring the whole fount into use, for the purpose of composing as many
pages as possible, the deficient sorts are cast, till the proportions
answer to each other. When this work is finished, another author’s
work is to be printed with the same letter: the disproportion
is again felt; those which at the first were deficient are now
superabundant, and those which were abundant will be deficient; so
that the master printer, to keep the whole of his letter in use
is obliged to be continually casting those deficiencies and thus
enlarging his founts.

The disuse of the long ſ, which took place some years ago, and also
of c‍t, has varied the proportions considerably of the letters
composing their combinations, b, h, i, k, l, and t.

The following Table shows the old numbers, also Smith’s and Earl
Stanhope’s; those at present cast by the letter founders, I give on
the authority of Messrs. Caslon and Livermore.

In Lists of Names, Indexes, and similar matter, the number of
capitals specified in this Bill would be greatly deficient; as would
also be the case with the accented letters for works in the Latin and
French languages. The figures and the em and en quadrats would be
found very inadequate for table work: in fact, in all these cases it
would be imperative to cast additional numbers.

Earl Stanhope introduced the following sorts, each in one piece, of
which he gives the following numbers to be cast for a fount of the
preceding weight:--an, 1,620--in, 1,731--of, 1,035--on, 897--re,
1,509--se, 1,152--th, 3,024--to, 1,095.--_See_ LOGOTYPE.

His Lordship, in fact, attempted to introduce too many alterations
in printing. I had the honour of knowing him for some years, and he
frequently described to me his intended improvements: one was, to
make the bottom of the boxes in the cases concave, so that the types
should always be convenient for the compositor to pick up; another
was, to lay four different sized types in the same pair of cases;
another, to alter the curve at the top of the f, and discard its
ligatures; another, to cast certain Logotypes. Some of these were
not improvements in practice; and the others, except they had been
generally adopted, would have destroyed uniformity in works that were
printed in different houses, in addition to the great expense and
inconvenience both to letter founders and printers. In attempting too
much, none of his plans were adopted, so far as related to composing.

Discarding the long ſ has also abolished ſb, ſh, ſi, ſk, ſl, ſſ, ſſi,
ſt, and has consequently increased the number of the round s, and the
connected letters.

BINDING. In locking-up a form, if the head-stick be longer than the
width of the page and the thickness of the back-stick; or the side or
foot stick extend beyond the page and the other be a little too long;
or any part of the furniture double over some other part, so as to
prevent the quoins wedging the matter tight, it is termed _Binding_:
_the head-stick binds_; _the side-sticks bind_, &c.--_M._


BITE. If the frisket is not sufficiently cut away, but covers some
part of the form, so that it prints on the frisket, it is called a
_Bite_.--_M._ It interposes between the form and the paper to be
printed on, and prevents the latter receiving the inked impression
intended to be transferred to it. A pressman looks carefully over
his first sheet to see that all is right, and if there be a bite he
cuts it out of the frisket with his scissors; if one should at first
escape his eye, it is cut out as soon as it is perceived.


BLACK LETTER

is the name now applied to the Old English or Modern Gothic
character, which was introduced into England about the middle of
the fourteenth century, and became the character generally used in
manuscript works before the art of printing was publicly practised
in Europe. On the application of that art to the multiplying of
books, about the middle of the fifteenth century, the Block Books,
and, subsequently, those printed with moveable types, were in this
letter, to imitate writing, and were disposed off as manuscripts.
When the first William Caslon commenced the business of type founding
he made great improvements in their shape, and his Gothic or black
letter remains unequalled, viewing it as an imitation of ancient
writing, the purest shape for the character originally intended for
a counterfeit manuscript. I am sorry to see our present founders
giving way to a barbarous caprice of fancy, by introducing arbitrary
shapes, which were unknown to our ancestors when this character was
in general use; for it appears inconsistent to call the following
Letters Old English, or Gothic, [Illustration]

Astle, in his Origin and Progress of Writing, says, “The Modern
Gothic, which spread itself all over Europe in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, is improperly so called, because it does not
derive its origin from the writing anciently used by the Goths and
Visigoths, in Italy and Spain, but this Modern Gothic is the most
barbarous or worst kind of writing; it took its rise in the decline
of the arts, among the lazy schoolmen, who had the worst taste; it is
nothing more than the Latin writing degenerated. This writing began
in the twelfth century, and was in general use (especially among
monks and schoolmen) in all parts of Europe, till the restoration
of the arts, in the fifteenth century, and longer in Germany and
the northern nations: Our statute books are still printed in Gothic
letters.” Astle’s work was published in 1784.

Flannel steeped in urine, in which pelt balls are wrapped up at
nights, and when they are not in use, to keep them soft.

Woollen cloth, or white baize, to lay between the tympans.--_M._
The blankets used for fine work are either superfine woollen cloth

BLANK PAGES.

When blank pages occur in a work, particularly in duodecimos and
smaller sizes, the compositor will find it an advantage to set them
up the exact size of the pages of the work, and made up to his gauge,
so that he will have his register good without the trouble that
attends filling the blank up with pieces of Furniture by guess work,
which causes extra trouble to the pressman.


BLASPHEMY.

  9 & 10 Will. 3. c. 32., intituled, “An Act for the more effectual
  suppressing of Blasphemy and Profaneness.”

  “Whereas many persons have of late years openly avowed and
  published many blasphemous and impious Opinions, contrary
  to the Doctrines and Principles of the Christian Religion,
  greatly tending to the Dishonour of Almighty God, and may prove
  destructive to the Peace and Welfare of this Kingdom: Wherefore
  for the more effectual suppressing of the said detestable Crimes,
  be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with
  the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
  the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
  Authority of the same, That if any Person or Persons, having
  been educated in, or at any Time having made Profession of the
  Christian Religion within this Realm, shall by Writing, Printing,
  Teaching, or advised Speaking, deny any one of the Persons in the
  Holy Trinity to be God, or shall assert or maintain there are
  more Gods than one, or shall deny the Christian Religion to be
  true, or the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be
  of Divine Authority, and shall upon Indictment or Information in
  any of his Majesty’s Courts at _Westminster_, or at the Assizes,
  be thereof lawfully convicted by the Oath of two or more credible
  Witnesses; such Person or Persons for the first Offence shall
  be adjudged incapable and disabled in Law, to all Intents and
  Purposes whatsoever, to have or enjoy any Office or Offices,
  Employment or Employments, Ecclesiastical, Civil, or Military,
  or any Part in them, or any Profit or Advantage appertaining to
  them, or any of them: And if any Person or Persons so convicted
  as aforesaid, shall at the Time of his or their Conviction, enjoy
  or possess any Office, Place, or Employment, such Office, Place,
  or Employment shall be void, and is hereby declared void: And if
  such Person or Persons shall be a second Time lawfully convicted
  as aforesaid, of all or any the aforesaid Crime or Crimes, that
  then he or they shall from thenceforth be disabled to sue,
  prosecute, plead or use any Action or Information in any Court
  of Law or Equity, or to be Guardian of any Child, or Executor or
  Administrator of any Person, or capable of any Legacy or Deed
  of Gift, or to bear any Office, Civil or Military, or Benefice
  Ecclesiastical for ever within this Realm, and shall also suffer
  Imprisonment for the Space of Three Years, without Bail or
  Mainprize, from the Time of such Conviction.

  s. 2. “Provided always, and be it enacted by the Authority
  aforesaid, That no Person shall be prosecuted by virtue of this
  Act, for any Words spoken, unless the Information of such Words
  shall be given upon Oath before one or more Justice or Justices
  of the Peace, within four Days after such Words spoken, and the
  Prosecution of such Offence be within three Months after such
  Information.

  s. 3. “Provided also, and be it enacted by the Authority
  aforesaid, That any Person or Persons convicted of all or any
  of the aforesaid Crime or Crimes, in Manner aforesaid, shall
  for the first Offence (upon his, her, or their Acknowledgment
  and Renunciation of such Offence or erroneous Opinions, in the
  same Court where such Person or Persons was or were convicted,
  as aforesaid, within the Space of four Months after his, her,
  or their Conviction) be discharged from all Penalties and
  Disabilities incurred by such Conviction; any thing in this Act
  contained to the contrary thereof in anywise notwithstanding.”

  Repealed as to denying the Trinity, by 53 Geo. 3. c. 160. s. 2.
  which is extended to Ireland by 57 Geo. 3. c. 70. _See_ LIBELS.

  53 Geo. 3. c. 160., intituled, “An Act to relieve Persons who
  impugn the Doctrine of the _Holy Trinity_ from certain Penalties.”

  s. 2. “And be it further enacted, That the Provisions of another
  Act passed in the Ninth and Tenth Years of the Reign of King
  _William_, intituled _An Act for the more effectual suppressing
  Blasphemy and Profaneness_, so far as the same relate to Persons
  denying as therein mentioned, respecting the _Holy Trinity_, be
  and the same are hereby repealed.

  s. 3. “And whereas it is expedient to repeal an Act, passed in
  the Parliament of _Scotland_ in the First Parliament of King
  _Charles_ the Second, intituled, _An Act against the Crime
  of Blasphemy_; and another Act, passed in the Parliament of
  _Scotland_ in the First Parliament of King _William_, intituled
  _Act against Blasphemy_; which Acts respectively ordain the
  Punishment of Death; be it therefore enacted, That the said
  Acts and each of them shall be, and the same are and is hereby
  repealed.

  s. 4. “And be it further enacted, That this Act shall be deemed
  and taken to be a Public Act, and shall be judicially taken
  Notice of as such by all Judges, Justices, and others, without
  being specially pleaded.”

  60 Geo. 3. c. 8. “An Act for the more effectual Prevention and
  Punishment of blasphemous and seditious Libels.”

  “Whereas it is expedient to make more effectual Provision for the
  Punishment of blasphemous and seditious Libels; be it enacted by
  the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and
  Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this
  present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same,
  That from and after the passing of this Act, in every Case in
  which any Verdict or Judgment by Default shall be had against any
  Person for composing, printing, or publishing any blasphemous
  Libel, or any seditious Libel, tending to bring into Hatred or
  Contempt the Person of His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, or
  the Regent, or the Government and Constitution of the United
  Kingdom as by Law established, or either House of Parliament, or
  to excite His Majesty’s Subjects to attempt the Alteration of
  any Matter in Church or State as by Law established, otherwise
  than by lawful Means, it shall be lawful for the Judge, or the
  Court before whom or in which such Verdict shall have been given,
  or the Court in which such Judgment by Default shall be had, to
  make an Order for the Seizure and carrying away, and detaining in
  safe Custody, in such Manner as shall be directed in such Order,
  all Copies of the Libel which shall be in the Possession of the
  Person against whom such Verdict or Judgment shall have been had,
  or in the Possession of any other Person named in the Order for
  his Use; Evidence upon Oath having been previously given to the
  Satisfaction of such Court or Judge, that a Copy or Copies of
  the said Libel is or are in the Possession of such other Person
  for the Use of the Person against whom such Verdict or Judgment
  shall have been had as aforesaid; and in every such Case it shall
  be lawful for any Justice of the Peace, or for any Constable or
  other Peace Officer acting under any such Order, or for any
  Person or Persons acting with or in Aid of any such Justice of
  the Peace, Constable, or other Peace Officer, to search for any
  Copies of such Libel in any House, Building, or other Place
  whatsoever belonging to the Person against whom any such Verdict
  or Judgment shall have been had, or to any other Person so named,
  in whose Possession any Copies of any such Libel, belonging to
  the Person against whom any such Verdict or Judgment shall have
  been had, shall be; and in case Admission shall be refused or not
  obtained within a reasonable Time after it shall have been first
  demanded, to enter by Force by Day into any such House, Building,
  or Place whatsoever, and to carry away all Copies of the Libel
  there found, and to detain the same in safe Custody until the
  same shall be restored under the Provisions of this Act, or
  disposed of according to any further Order made in relation
  thereto.

  s. 2. “And be it further enacted, That if in any such Case as
  aforesaid Judgment shall be arrested, or if, after Judgment shall
  have been entered, the same shall be reversed upon any Writ of
  Error, all Copies so seized shall be forthwith returned to the
  Person or Persons from whom the same shall have been so taken
  as aforesaid, free of all Charge and Expence, and without the
  Payment of any Fees whatever; and in every Case in which final
  Judgment shall be entered upon the Verdict so found against the
  Person or Persons charged with having composed, printed, or
  published such Libel, then all Copies so seized shall be disposed
  of as the Court in which such Judgment shall be given shall order
  and direct.

  s. 3. “Provided always, and be it enacted, That in _Scotland_,
  in every Case in which any Person or Persons shall be found
  guilty before the Court of Justiciary, of composing, printing, or
  publishing any blasphemous or seditious Libel, or where Sentence
  of Fugitation shall have been pronounced against any Person or
  Persons, in consequence of their failing to appear to answer
  to any Indictment charging them with having composed, printed,
  or published any such Libel, then and in either of such Cases,
  it shall and may be lawful for the said Court to make an Order
  for the Seizure, carrying away, and detaining in safe Custody,
  all Copies of the Libel in the Possession of any such Person or
  Persons named in such Order, for his or their Use, Evidence upon
  Oath having been previously given to the Satisfaction of such
  Court or Judge, that a Copy or Copies of the said Libel is or are
  in the Possession of such other Person for the Use of the Person
  against whom such Verdict or Judgment shall have been had as
  aforesaid; and every such Order so made shall and may be carried
  into effect, in such and the same Manner as any Order made by
  the Court of Justiciary, or any Circuit Court of Justiciary,
  may be carried into Effect according to the Law and Practice of
  _Scotland_: Provided always, that in the Event of any Person or
  Persons being reponed against any such Sentence of Fugitation,
  and being thereafter acquitted, all Copies so seized shall be
  forthwith returned to the Person or Persons from whom the same
  shall have been so taken as aforesaid; and in all other Cases,
  the Copies so seized shall be disposed of in such Manner as the
  said Court may direct.

  s. 4. “And be it further enacted, That if any Person shall,
  after the passing of this Act, be legally convicted of having,
  after the passing of this Act, composed, printed, or published
  any blasphemous Libel or any such seditious Libel as aforesaid,
  and shall, after being so convicted, offend a Second Time, and
  be thereof legally convicted before any Commission of Oyer and
  Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or in His Majesty’s Court of King’s
  Bench, such Person may, on such Second Conviction, be adjudged,
  at the Discretion of the Court, either to suffer such Punishment
  as may now by Law be inflicted in Cases of high Misdemeanors, or
  to be banished from the United Kingdom, and all other Parts of
  His Majesty’s Dominions, for such Term of Years as the Court in
  which such Conviction shall take place shall order.

  s. 5. “And be it further enacted, That in case any Person so
  sentenced and ordered to be banished as aforesaid, shall not
  depart from this United Kingdom within Thirty Days after the
  pronouncing of such Sentence and Order as aforesaid, for the
  Purpose of going into such Banishment as aforesaid, it shall
  and may be lawful to and for His Majesty to convey such Person
  to such Parts out of the Dominions of His said Majesty, as His
  Majesty by and with the Advice of His Privy Council shall direct.

  s. 6. “And be it further enacted, That if any Offender who shall
  be so ordered by any such Court as aforesaid to be banished in
  Manner aforesaid, shall after the End of Forty Days from the
  Time such Sentence and Order hath been pronounced, be at large
  within any Part of the United Kingdom, or any other Part of
  His Majesty’s Dominions, without some lawful Cause, before the
  Expiration of the Term for which such Offender shall have been so
  ordered to be banished as aforesaid, every such Offender being so
  at large as aforesaid, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be
  transported to such Place as shall be appointed by His Majesty
  for any Term not exceeding Fourteen Years.

  s. 7. “And be it further enacted, That the Clerk of Assize,
  Clerk of the Peace, or other Clerk or Officer of the Court
  having the Custody of the Records where any Offender shall
  have been convicted of having composed, printed, or published
  any blasphemous or seditious Libel, shall, upon Request of
  the Prosecutor on His Majesty’s Behalf, make out and give a
  Certificate in Writing, signed by him, containing the Effect and
  Substance only (omitting the formal Part) of every Indictment
  and Conviction of such Offender to the Justices of Assize, Oyer
  and Terminer, Great Sessions, or Gaol Delivery, where such
  Offender or Offenders shall be indicted for any Second Offence of
  composing, printing, or publishing any blasphemous or seditious
  Libel, for which Certificate Six Shillings and Eight-pence and
  no more shall be paid, and which Certificate shall be sufficient
  Proof of the Conviction of such Offender.

  s. 8. “And be it further enacted, That any Action and Suit which
  shall be brought or commenced against any Justice or Justices of
  the Peace, Constable, Peace Officer, or other Person or Persons,
  within that Part of _Great Britain_ called _England_, or in
  _Ireland_, for any thing done or acted in pursuance of this Act,
  shall be commenced within Six Calendar Months next after the Fact
  committed, and not afterwards; and the Venue in every such Action
  or Suit shall be laid in the proper County where the Fact was
  committed, and not elsewhere; and the Defendant or Defendants in
  every such Action or Suit may plead the General Issue, and give
  this Act and the special Matter in Evidence at any Trial to be
  had thereupon; and if such Action or Suit shall be brought or
  commenced after the Time limited for bringing the same, or the
  Venue shall be laid in any other Place than as aforesaid, then
  the Jury shall find a Verdict for the Defendant or Defendants;
  and in such Case, or if the Jury shall find a Verdict for the
  Defendant or Defendants upon the Merits, or if the Plaintiff or
  Plaintiffs shall become Nonsuit, or discontinue his, her, or
  their Actions after Appearance, or if, upon Demurrer, Judgment
  shall be given against the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs, the Defendant
  or Defendants shall have Double Costs, which he or they shall and
  may recover in such and the same Manner as any Defendant can by
  Law in other Cases.

  s. 9. “And be it further enacted, That every Action and Suit
  which shall be brought or commenced against any Person or Persons
  in _Scotland_, for any thing done or acted in pursuance of this
  Act, shall in like Manner be commenced within Six Calendar Months
  after the Fact committed, and not afterwards, and shall be
  brought in the Court of Session in _Scotland_; and the Defender
  or Defenders may plead that the Matter complained of was done in
  pursuance of this Act, and may give this Act and the special
  Matter in Evidence; and if such Action or Suit shall be brought
  or commenced after the Time limited for bringing the same, then
  the same shall be dismissed; and in such Case, or if the Defender
  or Defenders shall be assoilzied, or the Pursuer or Pursuers
  shall suffer the Action or Suit to fall asleep, or a Decision
  shall be pronounced against the Pursuer or Pursuers upon the
  Relevancy, the Defender or Defenders shall have Double Costs,
  which he or they shall and may receive in such and the same
  Manner as any Defender can by Law recover Costs or Expences in
  other Cases.

  s. 10. “Provided always, and be it further enacted, That nothing
  in this Act contained shall be held or considered as in any
  respect altering the Law or Practice of _Scotland_ regarding
  the Punishment of Persons convicted of composing, printing,
  publishing, or circulating any blasphemous or seditious
  Libel.”--_See_ LIBELS.


BLOCKED-UP.

Letter is said to be blocked-up, when in the progress of a work it
is all composed, and from any cause none of the forms can be worked
to disengage part of it, in order to proceed. This may arise--from
the Author not returning the proofs regularly--from the Reader
not reading them for press--from a flush of presswork in other
works--from the non-attendance or negligence of the pressmen--or
from compositors, in a companionship, keeping each too much copy in
his hands, whereby all the letter is composed before they join their
matter. From whatever cause it arises it is a great detriment, and
unhinges the regular train of work, and ought always to be avoided as
much as possible.

The term is also applied when the Pressmen use too much ink in
working a form; and when a form has been neglected to be washed, and
the ink left to dry on the face--_It is blocked-up with ink._


BLOCKS, for stereotype printing, _see_ RISERS.


BOARD RACK.

A case made of strong deal boards, with broad ledges nailed on the
inside of the two sides, to slide letter boards in: they are for the
purpose of putting boards in with pages and jobs on; as the matter
is safer and less likely to be broken, and more out of the way than
when scattered about on bulks, and also takes up less room. The sizes
are usually such as will admit demy and royal boards; but in houses
where works on large paper are printed, they have board racks that
will admit suitably larger boards.


BODKIN.

A piece of steel wire filed tapering to a point; the thick end being
fixed in a short wooden handle. Its use is to pick wrong letters out
of a page in correcting, in order to their being replaced by right
ones. A fine hackle tooth makes the best bodkin, and the finer the
point the better.


BODY.

The size of the shank of any type from the back of it to the front,
or the square of the m quadrat: thus English Body, Pica Body,
&c.--_M._ _See_ TYPES. TYPOGRAPHICAL POINTS.


BODY OF THE WORK.

The subject matter of a work is usually so termed, to distinguish it
from the notes, the preface, introduction, contents, and index.


BOLSTER.

A piece of stout leather strap nailed to the near long rib of a
wooden press, at the fore end, and padded under so as to raise
it sufficiently high; its use is to check the running out of the
carriage, by friction, at the proper place to permit the tympan to
rise clear of the platen, when the pressmen are in a train of work, a
similar piece being nailed under the carriage. In iron presses a bar
projects between the ribs on which is secured an inclined plane of
wood, and in some iron presses a spring is screwed on the near long
rib for the purpose. It prevents the sudden jerk upon the back stay,
and also upon the carriage when it is run out.


BOLTS.

The pieces of furniture that are placed between the head lines of the
pages in a form of twelves, to form the margin at the head of the
pages, are called _Bolts_.

The bolts are cut to the width of the page, so that the gutters go a
little way between them, and secure the sides of the pages the whole
length: I would recommend to the compositor to cut his bolts square
at the ends, and of such a length that they shall go into the measure
of his composing stick easily; he will thus prevent the folios or any
letters at the extremities of the head lines falling down, as well as
the bolts binding against the gutters.


BOOK HOUSE.

A printing office in which the printing of books is the chief
business carried on: in many houses in London the materials for this
purpose are most abundant; but at the same time they very rarely keep
any great assortment of large type for jobs. _See_ JOB HOUSE.


BOOK PRESS.

The Book Press, in the warehouse department, used for pressing books
previously to their delivery, is the common screw press with a
perpendicular screw, screwed down by means of an iron bar; it is also
used for pressing paper when wetted, for the purpose of improving
its condition previously to the process of printing, and also in
cylindrical or machine printing to cause the paper, and particularly
large sheets, to lie flat, which are otherwise apt to wrinkle in
being carried round the cylinders upon a flat surface. In large
establishments Bramah’s hydrostatic press is generally used for these
purposes, as being much more powerful and expeditious both in its use
and in its effect. _See_ HYDROSTATIC PRESS.


BOOKS.

  25 Hen. 8. c 15. intituled, “An Act for Printers and Binders of
  Books.”

  “‘Whereas by the Provision of a Statute made in the first Year
  of the Reign of King _Richard_ the Third, it was provided in the
  same Act, That all Strangers repairing into this Realm, might
  lawfully bring into the said Realm printed and written Books,
  to sell at their Liberty and Pleasure; (2) by Force of which
  Provision there hath come to this Realm sithen the making of
  the same, a marvellous Number at printed Books, and daily doth;
  and the Cause of the making of the same Provision seemeth to be,
  for that there were but few Books, and few Printers within this
  Realm at that Time, which could well exercise and occupy the said
  Science and Craft of Printing; nevertheless, sithen the making of
  the said Provision, many of this Realm, being the King’s natural
  Subjects, have given them so diligently to learn and exercise
  the said Craft of Printing, that at this Day there be within
  this Realm a great Number cunning and expert in the said Science
  or Craft of Printing, as able to exercise the said Craft in all
  Points, as any Stranger in any other Realm or Country: (3) And
  furthermore, where there be a great Number of the King’s Subjects
  within this Realm, which live by the Craft and Mystery of Binding
  of Books, and that there be a great Multitude well expert in the
  same, yet all this notwithstanding, there are divers Persons that
  bring from beyond the Sea great Plenty of printed Books, not only
  in the _Latin_ Tongue, but also in our maternal _English_ Tongue,
  some bound in Boards, some in Leather, and some in Parchment,
  and them sell by retail, whereby many of the King’s Subjects,
  being Binders of Books, and having no other Faculty wherewith to
  get their Living, be destitute of Work, and like to be undone,
  except some Reformation herein be had:’ Be it therefore enacted
  by the King our Sovereign Lord, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
  and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by
  Authority of the same, That the said Proviso, made in the first
  Year of the said King Richard the Third, from the Feast of the
  _Nativity_ of our Lord God next coming, shall be void and of none
  Effect.

  s. 4. “Provided alway, and be it enacted by the Authority
  aforesaid, That if any of the said Printers or Sellers of printed
  Books, inhabited within this Realm, at any Time hereafter happen
  in such wise to inhance or increase the Prices of any such
  printed Books, in Sale or Binding, at too high and unreasonable
  Prices, in such wise as Complaint be made thereof unto the King’s
  Highness, or unto the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or any
  of the Chief Justices of the one Bench or of the other; that
  then the same Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, and two Chief
  Justices, or two of any of them, shall have Power and Authority
  to enquire thereof, as well by the Oaths of twelve honest and
  discreet Persons, as otherwise by due Examination by their
  Discretions. (2) And after the same inhancing and increasing of
  the said Prices of the said Books and Binding shall be so found
  by the said twelve Men, or otherwise by Examination of the said
  Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer and Justices, or two of them;
  that then the same Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer and Justices,
  or two of them at the least, from Time to Time shall have Power
  and Authority to reform and redress such inhancing of the Prices
  of printed Books from Time to Time by their Discretions, and to
  limit Prices as well of the Books as for the Binding of them; (3)
  and over that the Offender or Offenders thereof being convict
  by the Examination of the same Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer
  and two Justices, or two of them, or otherwise, shall lose and
  forfeit for every Book by them sold, whereof the Price shall be
  inhanced for the Book or Binding thereof, three Shillings four
  Pence; the one Half thereof shall be to the King’s Highness, and
  the other Half to the Parties grieved that will complain upon the
  same in Manner and Form before rehearsed.”

  (_Sections_ 2. _&_ 3. _Repealed by_ 3 _Geo._ 4. _c._ 41. _s._ 2.)

  By the Act 3 & 4 Will. 4. c. 52. s. 58. Books are absolutely
  prohibited to be imported for Sale, being “first composed
  or written or printed in the United Kingdom, and printed or
  reprinted in any other Country, except Books not reprinted in the
  United Kingdom within Twenty Years; or being Parts of Collections
  the greater parts of which had been composed or written abroad.”

  By the “Table of New Duties, 1834,” in 4 & 5 Will. 4. c. 89.,
  the Customs Duties Inwards are for “Books in the Foreign living
  Languages, being of Editions printed in or since the Year One
  thousand eight hundred and one, bound or unbound, the cwt. 2_l._
  10_s._”

  2 & 3 Vict. c. 23. s. 1. Drawbacks on Excise Duty. “For every
  Pound Weight Avoirdupois of printed Books in perfect and complete
  Sets, or, if periodical Publications, in perfect Parts or
  Numbers, and of blank, plain, or ruled Account Books, whether
  bound or unbound, made of or printed or ruled on Paper made and
  charged with Duty in the United Kingdom, and which shall be
  exported as Merchandise, a Drawback of One Penny Halfpenny.”
  _See_ PAPER.

  BOOKS. (Ireland.) 4 Geo. 4. c 72. “An Act to repeal the several
  Duties and Drawbacks of Customs, chargeable and allowable in
  _Ireland_, on the Importation and Exportation of certain Foreign
  and Colonial Goods, Wares, and Merchandize, and to grant other
  Duties and Drawbacks in lieu thereof, equal to the Duties and
  Drawbacks chargeable and allowable thereon in _Great Britain_.”

  Duties of Customs on Goods, &c. imported into Ireland.

                                                       Duty.
  Books, printed, or Manuscripts, _viz._           £  _s.   d._
  ---- half-bound, or in any way bound, the Cwt.   6   10    0
  ---- unbound, the Cwt.                           5    0    0
  No Drawback.
  The same Duties from the East Indies.


BOOKING.

The act of putting the different gatherings of a work together, in
the warehouse, so as to make complete books. This is done by laying
the gatherings in order upon a table, and, commencing with the first,
taking them up in order; by adopting this method they are gathered
under hand, as it may be termed, the succession being placed at
the bottom as the person proceeds. The reverse of this method, is,
however, to be preferred; to commence at the end of the work, and
as the gathering is held in the hand, and rests on the arm, to lay
the others upon it as they are taken up, so that in this way the
commencement of the book will be the last to be gathered.

thus, if the work be printed with a Pica type, the notes will be
composed in Long Primer; if with English, the notes will be Small
Pica. They are also termed _Foot Notes_.


BOURGEOIS.

The name of a type, a size larger than Brevier, and smaller than Long
Primer. It is not enumerated in Moxon’s list of the sizes of types.
_See_ TYPES.

BOW THE LETTER.

When compositors pick a bad letter out of a form in correcting, it is
usual to rub the face of it on the stone and to _bend_ the shank, if
it be not a thick letter; this is done to prevent such letters being
distributed and used again; in Moxon’s time it was styled _bowing_
a letter. After the form is locked-up and the stone cleared, these
_bowed_ (or _bent_) letters are thrown into the shoe.


BOWYER.

Extract from the Will of Mr. William Bowyer, Printer, who died on the
18th of November, 1777, when he had nearly completed his 78th year.

  “_And now I hope_ I may be allowed to leave somewhat for the
  benefit of printing. To this end, I give to the master and
  keepers, or wardens and commonalty, of the mistery or art of a
  Stationer of the city of _London_, such a sum of money as will
  purchase Two Thousand Pounds, three _per cent._ Reduced Bank
  Annuities, _upon trust_, to pay the dividends and yearly produce
  thereof, to be divided for ever equally amongst three printers,
  compositors or pressmen, to be elected from time to time by the
  master, wardens, and assistants, of the said company, and who
  at the time of such election shall be sixty-three years old or
  upwards, for their respective lives, to be paid half yearly;
  hoping that such as shall be most deserving will be preferred.
  AND WHEREAS I have herein before given to my son the sum of Three
  Thousand Pounds four _per cent._ Consolidated Annuities, in case
  he marries with the consent of my executors: now, I do hereby
  GIVE AND BEQUEATH the dividends and interest of that sum, till
  such marriage takes place, to the said Company of Stationers,
  to be divided equally between six other printers, compositors
  or pressmen, as aforesaid, in manner as aforesaid; and, if my
  said son shall die unmarried, or married without such consent
  as aforesaid, then I GIVE AND BEQUEATH the said capital sum of
  Three Thousand Pounds to the said Company of Stationers, the
  dividends and yearly produce thereof to be divided for ever
  equally amongst six other such old printers, compositors or
  pressmen, for their respective lives, to be qualified, chosen,
  and paid, in manner as aforesaid.--_It has long been to_ me
  matter of concern, that such numbers are put apprentices, as
  compositors, without any share of school-learning, who ought
  to have the greatest: in hopes of remedying this, I GIVE AND
  BEQUEATH to the said Company of Stationers such a sum of money
  as will purchase One Thousand Pounds three _per cent._ Reduced
  Bank Annuities, for the use of one journeyman compositor, such
  as shall hereafter be described, _with this special trust_, that
  the master, wardens, and assistants, shall pay the dividends and
  produce thereof half-yearly to such compositor: the said master,
  wardens, and assistants, of the said company, shall nominate
  for this purpose a compositor who is a man of good life and
  conversation, who shall usually frequent some place of public
  worship every _Sunday_, unless prevented by sickness, and shall
  not have worked on a newspaper or magazine for four years at
  least before such nomination, nor shall ever afterwards whilst
  he holds this annuity, which may be for life if he continues
  a journeyman: he shall be able to read and construe _Latin_,
  and at least to read _Greek_ fluently with accents; of which
  he shall bring a testimonial from the rector of _St. Martin’s,
  Ludgate_, for the time being: I could wish that he shall have
  been brought up piously and virtuously, if it be possible, at
  _Merchant Taylor’s_, or some other public school, from seven
  years of age till he is full seventeen, and then to serve seven
  years faithfully as a compositor, and work seven years more as a
  journeyman, as I would not have this annuity bestowed on any one
  under thirty-one years of age: if, after he is chosen, he should
  behave ill, let him be turned out, and another be chosen in his
  stead. AND WHEREAS it may be many years before a compositor may
  be found that shall exactly answer the above description, and
  it may at some time happen that such a one cannot be found; I
  would have the dividends in the meantime applied to such person
  as the master, wardens, and assistants, shall think approaches
  nearest to what I have described. AND WHEREAS the above trusts
  will occasion some trouble; I GIVE to the said Company, in case
  they think proper to accept the trusts, two hundred and fifty
  pounds.”--_Extracted from Anecdotes, Literary and Biographical,
  of Mr. Bowyer, by J. N._ [John Nichols?] _in Gent. Mag. Dec._
  1778, _p._ 570.

  6,000_l._ stock was immediately transferred by the executors of
  Mr. Bowyer, and now stands in the name of the Company; the yearly
  dividend is 180_l._--_Hansard’s Typographia, p._ 280. _Note._


BOX.

The divisions of a case, in which the letters lie, are termed Boxes;
as the _a_ box, the _e_ box, the _i_ box, &c.


BOX. The female screw in the head of a press, in which the spindle
works. It is made of brass, and is usually cast on the screw of the
spindle, round on the outside with a projecting part of about half
an inch on the whole length of each opposite side, to keep it firm
in the head, and prevent it turning round. It is fitted tightly into
the head, and kept in its place by two bolts, driven into the under
side, with return heads which project over the bottom of the box. It
is also called the Nut of the Spindle.


BOXWOOD.

The best boxwood used in engraving is of a good yellow colour, of
a fine close grain, that has been of a slow growth, clear of knots
and any imperfections, such as cracks or flaws; the finest lines may
be engraved on this wood, as it is both hard and tough, and, with
care in printing, the number of impressions that may be taken from
an engraving on it would appear incredible. Papillon, in his History
of Engraving on Wood, gives a specimen, from which, he states, there
had been upwards of three hundred and seventy thousand impressions
previously printed; and if the block had been carefully cleaned, and
well printed, it would still have produced respectable impressions.
Boxwood of a dull bad yellow colour, and of an open coarse grain,
is not fit for engraving on, neither is wood that is of a blackish
colour at the heart; for, in these cases, it has begun to decay, is
brittle and tender, and if engraved on, the lines would not stand,
but would fail in printing. Our principal supply of boxwood comes
from the Levant, and is called Turkey box.


BRACE.

A character cast in metal thus marked ⏞ . The compositor is to have
these cast of several breadths, viz. to several number of lines of a
designed body (most commonly of Pica body) that they may hook in or
brace so many lines as his copy may show him.--_M._

It is used in poetry at the end of a triplet, or three lines which
have the same rhyme.

Braces are also used to connect a number of words with one common
term, and are introduced to prevent a repetition in writing or
printing.--_Murray._

Braces are cast to different bodies as high as English; and braces
on Long Primer are now cast from three to eight ems in length, which
look much neater than the old fashion of middles and corners, filled
up with metal rules.

The founders in casting long Braces always make the swell in the
face of them proportionably thick to their length, so that in using
them with small letter they look heavy and clumsy; I would recommend
that long Braces should be cast to a small body, not larger than
Brevier, and the faces of all the lengths uniform, so that when
there happens to be a range of them of different lengths in a page
they might harmonize, and not make such an incongruous appearance as
they now do. When Braces are wanted longer than those already cast,
I would not use middles and corners, but make them of Brass Rule in
one continued piece, which has a better appearance than when they are
joined, and which may be made with a file in a neat manner by any
clever compositor.


BRACKET. _See_ CROTCHET.


BRAMAH’S PRESS. _See_ HYDROSTATIC PRESS.


BRANCHING-OUT.

Opening or extending the matter in title-pages, heads of pages, or
other parts, and also in jobs, with quadrats, leads, reglet, or other
proper materials.


BRASS RULES.

Pieces of brass of different thicknesses made letter high, to print
with.--_M._ They are made in lengths of fourteen inches, but of late
years lengths half as long again have been made; one of the edges
is bevilled so as to print a fine line, and when a thicker line is
required the bottom edge is placed uppermost, which is the full
thickness of the brass; by this means lines of different thicknesses
are obtained, and also double lines, a thick one and a fine one when
required. They are used for column lines in table work; to separate
matter that requires to be distinct; and to be placed round pages.

I have found in practice that the best way of forming a good joining
at the corners with brass rule, is to cut the rules a little longer
than the precise length wanted, and to let one piece project a little
at each corner; to push the other piece close up, and, when the form
is locked up, then to file the projecting parts away, which makes the
corners equal, as shown below.

[Illustration: two rectangles side by side]

Wherever two rules join, the end of that which abuts on the other
should be cut with a little bevil, so that the upper side should
project a little to form a junction with the face of the other; this
also prevents the rule binding at bottom.

An ingenious compositor will make many things out of brass rules,
such as neat long braces, instead of using middles, corners, and
metal rules, which rarely join well, swell rules of different
varieties, and many fancy rules, as occasion may require.

In cases where diagrams are required, and there is no engraver within
reach, they may be formed by a clever workman, with brass rule. There
have been of late years many ingenious and elaborate performances
with this article in imitation of architectural drawings of
buildings, with pillars, &c.; and I believe no one has displayed more
ingenuity and skill in the production of such works than Mr. Ebenezer
Parkes, of Fetter Lane.


[Illustration: A tool to spread ink ]

BRAYER.

A round wooden rubber with an upright handle, almost of the fashion
of a ball stock, but solid and flat at the bottom, and not above
three inches in diameter. It is used on the ink block, to bray or rub
out ink with so as to spread it out in such a manner that a small
quantity may be taken up when the ball is pressed upon the block,
tolerably diffused upon the surface, and not in a mass, which causes
the ink to be more expeditiously distributed, with less risk of
making monks and friars.

BREAK.

A piece of a line.--_M._ The last line of a paragraph.


BREVE. _See_ ACCENTED LETTERS.


BREVIER.

The name of a type, a size smaller than Bourgeois, and larger than
Minion. In Moxon’s time 112 Brevier bodies measured a foot. _See_
TYPES.


BRING-UP.

To bring-up a form of types is to place overlays over those parts
on which the pressure is deficient in order to increase it and to
equalize it over the whole surface of the form.

With wood-cuts, in which an equal pressure over the whole surface
is not wanted, it is to place underlays on the bottom of the block,
under those parts which require to come stronger than the rest, these
are the dark parts and the foreground, and to cut away the tympan
sheet over the light parts and the distances when requisite, and
to overlay those parts which require to be firm, with smooth thin
paper. I have always found India paper the best, but the minute hard
particles and all the extraneous substances, should be taken out by
scraping it carefully with a knife, so as to render it quite smooth
and even, otherwise the engraving will be injured.

In order to produce the finest impression possible, it is necessary
that it should be the impression of the surface of the types and the
engraving, and the surface only; therefore it is requisite to have
very little blanket in the tympans, and that of the finest kerseymere
or woollen cloth, or paper alone, so that it shall not be pressed in
between the lines, which, when the pressman neglects this precaution,
produces rough coarse lines; of course the overlays should be as few
as possible and of very thin paper. _See_ FINE PRESSWORK, MAKING
READY, OVERLAY, UNDERLAY.


BROAD.

The technical name of a piece of furniture equal in width to a broad
quotation.


BROADSIDE.

A form of one full page, printed on one side of a whole sheet
of paper, whatever size the paper may be of: thus, we have demy
broadsides--royal broadsides--double crown broadsides, &c.


BROKEN LETTER.

By broken letter is not meant the breaking of the shanks of any of
the letters, but the breaking of the orderly succession in which the
letters stood in a line, page, or form, &c. and mingling the letters
together, these mingled letters being called pie.--_M._ Instead of
Broken Letter it is now styled Broken Matter.


BROKEN MATTER.

The deranging the order of types after they are composed, so as to
make it pie. Moxon styles it BROKEN LETTER, which _see_.


BROKEN NECK.

A ball is said to be broken-necked, when the wool in the bowl of the
ball stock separates from the body of wool in the ball; so that when
the ball is held in a horizontal position by the handle it hangs down
in a flabby manner.


[Illustration: A loose bulk table]

BULK.

A platform fixed to the end of a frame on which to put a letter board
with letter; there is another sort sometimes adopted, called a Loose
Bulk, which is a small table made of deal, for the same purpose, but
moveable to any part where it is most convenient to use it.


BULLET.

When a workman, at case or press, either for neglect, want of
punctuality, or for gross misconduct, is discharged instanter, and
the usual notice of “a fortnight” is not given, it is said, _He has
got the Bullet_.


BUNDLE.

A bundle of paper consists of two reams. _See_ PAPER, REAM.


BUR. _See_ RAG.


BUTTON OF THE TYMPAN.

An iron button with a female screw, screwed on a square shanked bolt,
that goes through the bottom frame of the outer tympan, in wooden
presses, and turns on the upper side of the inner tympan, to assist
in keeping it tight in its place.

In very fine work also, when the paper is stout and heavy and large
sheets, and it is not customary to fly the frisket, but to turn it
down upon the paper before the tympan is turned down upon the form,
a button is placed upon the lower frame of the outer tympan, which
clasps the extreme end of the frisket, and confines the sheet of
paper in its place on the tympan, and prevents it slipping down.




C.


CANCEL.

At the conclusion of a work, if there be any leaves cancelled, it
is useful to place a mark in the white line of the odd page of the
reprinted leaf, to prevent a mistake on the part of the bookbinder; a
*, †, ‡, ‖, or §, either upright or laid flat. This is too frequently
neglected, and when the warehouseman omits tearing or cutting the
cancelled leaf, the wrong one occasionally is bound in the book. To
save press work and paper, cancel leaves are always imposed with the
fragments, if possible.

Before the book is gathered, the warehouseman should either tear the
cancelled leaf or run his knife up it, so as to prevent it being
overlooked by the bookbinder; running the knife up it is the most
expeditious method, and, to prevent mistakes, he ought to do this
himself, and not to entrust it to boys, as cutting a wrong leaf would
cause another leaf to be reprinted, and he might be held responsible
for the expense, and also incur censure on account of delay.


CANON.

The name of a type, a size larger than Trafalgar, and the largest
with a specific name. The body is four Picas, the next size being
four line Pica, and so upwards, reckoning by lines of Pica. _See_
TYPES.


CAP.

The top part of a wooden press; it has two mortises at each end to
receive the tenons at the upper end of each cheek, by which it keeps
the cheeks at a proper distance at the top; and the head is suspended
from it by two iron bolts, with screws and nuts at the upper end, by
which the pull also is regulated.


CAPITALS.

The following directions respecting the use of capital letters, are
extracted from Lindley Murray’s English Grammar.

‘It was formerly the custom to begin every noun with a capital: but
as this practice was troublesome, and gave the writing or printing
a crowded and confused appearance, it has been discontinued. It is,
however, very proper to begin with a capital,

‘1. The first word of every book, chapter, letter, note, or any other
piece of writing.

‘2. The first word after a period; and, if the two sentences are
_totally independent_, after a note of interrogation or exclamation.

‘But if a number of interrogative or exclamatory sentences are
thrown into one general group, or if the construction of the latter
sentences depends on the former, all of them, except the first, may
begin with a small letter: as, “How long, ye simple ones, will ye
love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning? and
fools hate knowledge?” “Alas! how different! yet how like the same!”

‘3. The appellations of the Deity: as, “God, Jehovah, the Almighty,
the Supreme Being, the Lord, Providence, the Messiah, the Holy
Spirit.”

‘4. Proper names of persons, places, streets, mountains, rivers,
ships: as, “George, York, the Strand, the Alps, the Thames, the
Seahorse.”

‘5. Adjectives derived from the proper names of places: as, “Grecian,
Roman, English, French, and Italian.”

‘6. The first word of a quotation, introduced after a colon, or when
it is in a direct form: as, “Always remember this ancient maxim:
‘Know thyself.’” “Our great Lawgiver says, ‘Take up thy cross daily,
and follow me.’” But when a quotation is brought in obliquely after a
comma, a capital is unnecessary: as, “Solomon observes, ‘that pride
goes before destruction.’”

‘The first word of an example may also very properly begin with a
capital: as, “Temptation proves our virtue.”

‘7. Every substantive and principal word in the titles of books: as,
“Johnson’s Dictionary of the English Language;” “Thomson’s Seasons;”
“Rollin’s Ancient History.”

‘8. The first word of every line in poetry.

‘9. The pronoun _I_, and the interjection _O_, are written in
capitals: as, “I write:” “Hear, O earth!”

‘Other words, besides the preceding, may begin with capitals, when
they are remarkably emphatical, or the principal subject of the
composition.’


CAPPING BALLS.

Wrapping up pelt balls in blankets soaked in urine at night, and when
they are not in use, to keep them soft. They are generally left on
the floor of the sink.


CAPPING A MAN.

Wrapping one of the blankets with which the pelt balls are capped
about a man’s head, and tying it round his neck. This most filthy and
disgusting punishment is very rarely inflicted in a press room; yet I
have read an account of a trial at the Old Bailey for an assault, in
which this act was the ground of offence.


CARD.

When several bodies of letter are set in a page, compositors to
justify that page to an exact length, put a card to some white line,
or other break, and lengthen out the page the thickness of a card.
Pressmen also use a card for an underlay.--_M._ Cards are rarely used
now for these purposes; in making up pages, leads and scaleboards
are used, and, where great nicety is required, a careful compositor
will cut slips of smooth even paper, and use them where a lead or a
scaleboard would be too much. At press, underlays are not used for
types; and where an engraving on wood is much too low, the pressman
will underlay it with thick wrapper paper. In fact, cards are an
article that neither composing rooms nor press rooms are supplied
with.


CARDS.

About a quire of paper, which pressmen use to pull down the spring or
rising of a form, which it is many times subject to by hard locking
up.--_M._

The term is also applied to pieces of scaleboard, old felted hat, or
pasteboard, for they are all called cards, cut to the size of the
mortises in the cheeks of a wooden press, and laid in them, under the
tenons of the winter, and above those of the head, to cause a spring
in both these parts, for the purpose of softening the pull. I would
never place any cards under the winter, for the reasons assigned
under that article. _See_ WINTER.


CARD WOOL.

The act of carding wool to stuff the balls with, to take out the
knots, dirt, &c., for the purpose of making the balls softer, more
elastic, and to have a more even surface than would be the case if
the wool were not carded. This operation is repeated every time a
pair of balls is knocked up. Formerly it was teazed, and not carded.


CARET.

A caret, marked thus ^, is placed where some word happens to be left
out in writing, and which is inserted over the line. This mark is
also called a circumflex, when placed over some vowel of a word, to
denote a long syllable: as, “Euphrâtes.”--_Murray._


CARRIAGE,

is that part of the press that runs in under the platen, including
the plank, coffin, &c. I am aware that many printers call the long
wooden ribs and frame the carriage; but I am also satisfied that they
misname that part of the press: for who ever heard of running in the
long ribs? yet to run in the carriage is a common expression; and the
name implies that the article moves or travels. This word bore the
signification which I assign to it in the seventeenth century, for
Moxon uses it in this sense. _See_ RUN IN THE CARRIAGE.


CASE,

in which the letters are laid to compose with.--_M._

Cases are always spoken of as pairs; viz. upper case and lower case;
when placed upon a frame to compose out of, the front of the upper
case rests against the back of the lower case, lying in different
inclinations, the back of the upper case being raised to bring the
top boxes nearer the hand.

They are generally made of beech; the outer rim and the middle bar
stout, to give strength, and to nail the bottoms to, which are lined
with paper, to prevent letters falling through cracks, or joints
that might open; this lining used to be cartridge paper, which
strengthened the bottom, but the joiner now lines them with cheap and
thin demy paper; the bottom is made of thin fir deal. The dimensions
are--two feet eight inches and a half, sometimes two feet nine inches
long; one foot two inches and a half wide, and one inch and a quarter
deep; the front being about half an inch broader than the depth,
which forms a ledge for galleys to rest against, and also serves as a
guard to stop letters, &c. falling over.

It is interesting to trace the changes that take place in any art;
hence I have given the arrangement of the letters in cases at
different periods, commencing with the first English writer, Moxon,
who published his work in the year 1683; then Smith, who published
in 1755; the cases before the long ſ was discarded, in my own time;
the arrangement now generally used; and a variation, subdividing the
boxes in the upper case, and changing the arrangement, both in that
and the lower case, to afford room for a greater number of sorts, and
to make the access to them more convenient; I have also added the
late Earl Stanhope’s plan.

In Moxon’s cases it will be perceived there are no ç, ſb, ſk, Œ, ‡,
‖, ¶, [, (, |, nor any small capitals.

Smith, in his Printer’s Grammar, gives “Schemes for Three Pair of
Cases, shewing the Difference in the Disposition of their Sorts.” I
have given his No. I. and No. III.; No. II. is the same as the one
before the long ſ was discarded, with the exception of the q being
in the comma box, and the comma in the q box.

This arrangement of the letters before the long ſ was discarded,
continued down to our own time, except the transposition of the q
and the comma; and the “schemes” Smith gives as No. I. and No. III.
became obsolete.

When the long ſ was discarded, and we confined ourselves to one shape
of the same letter, the ligature ct was also disused; we thus lost
the ct, ſb, ſh, ſi, ſk, ſl, ſſ, ſſi, ſſl, and ſt, which gave ten
additional boxes for other sorts; these have afforded convenience for
metal rules and braces, which before were wanted, and also for the £
and [#] that are now frequently sent with a fount, particularly the
£.

The discarding of the long ſ originated with the late John Bell, who
printed and published an edition of Shakspeare, the British Theatre,
and the Poets: the change was not generally adopted for some years,
and many retained one ſ when two came together, as ‘Eſsay;’ but the s
prevailed, and no other is now used.

In the present arrangement, the figures are brought lower down to be
nearer the hand, and the vowels with the diæresis moved higher up;
for the same reason the acute accented vowels have changed places
with those of the grave accent.

Mr. Johnson, in his Typographia, has given a variation in the
arrangement that he has adopted. I do not see any improvement in the
lower case to induce master printers to change the general mode,
which would only tend to create confusion and put the boxes into pie.
A subdivision of the boxes in the upper case, would be useful in two
or three pairs in large founts, that had superiors and fractions cast
to them; but as few founts have them, these subdivisions would not
only be useless, but inconvenient, if applied to all the cases, as
they would not leave sufficient room for metal rules, braces, &c.,
neither do they afford convenience for all the fractions that are
cast in a piece; besides, vowels with the long and short accents are
so rarely used in the general routine of business, that it is not
necessary to cramp the boxes to make provision for them; and there
is always room in the back boxes of the Italic cases in which to
put sorts that are seldom wanted; to this we may add the additional
expense of making these cases, which in an extensive business would
be considerable.

Among the various arrangements of the types in cases at different
periods and by different persons, I am gratified at being enabled
to give that of the late Earl Stanhope, from a stereotype plate of
his Lordship’s casting; this plan of the cases, the logotypes, the
alteration of the letter f, and the shape of the boxes, were never
adopted in the trade.

PECULIARITIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THESE CASES.

  _First._ The nine logotypes now in use are omitted. They are
  proposed to be printed with separate types, thus: ff, fi, fl,
  ffi, ffl, &c. instead of ﬀ, ﬁ, ﬂ, ﬃ, ﬄ, &c. And the Italic
  thus: _ff_, _fi_, _fl_, &c. _instead of ﬀ_, _ﬁ_, _ﬂ_, &c. In 20
  pages of Enfield’s Speaker, (namely, from page 71 to 90, both
  inclusive,) those logotypes occur only 95 times, viz.

  PRESENT LOGOTYPES.

  ff  fi  fl  ffi  ffl  Æ  Œ  æ  œ } TOTAL,
  28  51  10   4    2   0  0  0  0 }  95.

  _SECONDLY._ EIGHT NEW LOGOTYPES ARE INTRODUCED. THEIR REGULAR
  AND FREQUENT OCCURRENCE EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF COMPOSITION IN A
  VERY CONSIDERABLE DEGREE; FOR, IN THOSE SAME 20 PAGES, THE NEW
  LOGOTYPES WOULD SAVE TO THE COMPOSITOR NO LESS THAN 3073 LIFTS,
  VIZ.

   th  in  an  re  se  to  of  on } Total,
  771 441 413 385 291 279 264 229 } 3073.

  _Thirdly._ The introduction of the new logotypes, and the great
  imperfection of the various existing arrangements of composing
  cases, have caused the above new and very superior arrangement to
  be adopted.

  _Fourthly._ The front side of each box of the lower case is made
  sloping, instead of upright: which shape is convenient both to
  the view and to the hand of the compositor, and it enables him
  to lift the types with the same rapidity and ease when the boxes
  are nearly empty as when they are full. The types are much better
  preserved from wear, by means of this shape. It also allows the
  lower case to be made deeper than usual; so that, two of them
  contain as much as three lower cases on the old construction.
  At the bottom of each box of the upper case, the internal front
  arras is filled up.

  The saving of time is of immense importance, especially in all
  cases where dispatch is particularly required. The new cases are,
  by experience, found to save full _one day_ out of _six_ to the
  compositor.

  Fifteen boxes on the left-hand side of the upper case are
  represented empty. They are intended for the sorts which are
  sometimes used for particular works; such as, accented letters,
  mathematical marks, &c.

  As the asterisk, or star, [*] is very liable to be filled with
  ink at press, it is intentionally excluded from among the
  reference-marks.

_Stereotyped and Printed by EARL STANHOPE, Chevening House, Kent._


CASE IS FULL.

A case full of letters, wanting no sorts.--_M._


CASE IS LOW.

When a case grows empty, compositors say, The Case is Low.--_M._


CASE RACK.

A frame made of strong deal boards, with ledges nailed on the inside
of the sides, in which to slide cases that are not in use, to keep
them safe. They are usually made to contain fourteen pairs of cases;
they are two feet nine inches wide in the clear, and seven feet high.

Where full cases of letter are kept for the purpose of expediting any
new work that requires great despatch, some houses have a bar of iron
from top to bottom, and lock the cases up to preserve the letter.


CASE RUNS OVER.

When a compositor distributes so much letter into a case as to fill
the boxes till the letters mingle with those in the adjoining boxes,
he says, his _Case runs over_, or it overflows. This frequently
causes additional errors in the proof, and of course is not an
advisable practice.


CASE STANDS STILL.

When the compositor is not at work at his case, it is said, The Case
stands still.--_M._ Obsolete.


CASSIE PAPER.

The two outside quires of a ream. They are also called Cassie Quires,
because they serve for cases to the ream.--_M._ _See_ OUTSIDE QUIRES.


CASTING. _See_ ELECTROTYPE.


CASTING UP.

Calculating the number of thousands of letters in a sheet of any
work, or in a job, in order to fix the price for composing it.

To facilitate the ascertainment of the number of thousands of letters
in a sheet of bookwork, and also of jobs, I have given a set of
tables, which I believe includes, generally speaking, the sizes of
the pages that usually occur in practice. These tables will be found
useful to those compositors who are not expert at figures, while
those who are so may save time by referring to them, and they may
also serve as a check to their own casting up. The figures at the
top designate the number of lines the page is long; and the figures
in the column specify the number of thousands of letters in a sheet,
according to the size named in the head. To ascertain the number of
thousands of letters, the established rule is, to take the number of
lines the page is long, including the head line and the direction
line, and the number of en quadrats in the width of the page, the en
quadrat being estimated as the average thickness of the letters, and
on multiplying the one by the other the product will give the number
of letters in a page; and this product multiplied by the number of
pages in a sheet, gives the number of letters in a sheet; where there
is a fraction of a thousand, and that fraction amounts to 500 or
upwards, it is reckoned and charged as 1,000; when it is less than
500 it is dropped, and not included in the calculation. There are
some exceptions to this general rule of taking the dimensions when
the type exceeds a certain size, for which _see_ SCALE OF PRICES.

CAST LEADS. _See_ SPACE LINES.


CAST OFF COPY.

Counting or Casting off Copy (for both phrases are indifferently
used) is to examine and find how much either of printed copy will
come in into any intended number of sheets of a different body or
measure from the copy; or how much written copy will make an intended
number of sheets of any assigned body and measure.--_M._ It is also
used to ascertain how many sheets of a given sized page and letter
any quantity of prepared copy will make.

This is generally done by composing a line or two of the copy, if it
be manuscript, selected from the part that appears about the average
mode of writing, and ascertaining how many lines of the printed or
manuscript copy will make even lines in the proposed size; thus, if
10 lines of copy make 7 lines, or 7 lines of copy make 10 lines, the
quantity is easily calculated. Allowance must of course be made for
chapter heads, short pages, and any whites that may occur.


[Illustration: A tool to catch the press bar]

CATCH OF THE BAR

is a piece of wood two inches thick, four inches broad, and ten
inches long, with a groove in the lower part of it by which it is
screwed to the front of the off cheek, and may be heightened or
lowered at pleasure; the top of it is a little bevilled or sloped
off, that the bar may by its spring fly up the bevil till it
stick.--_M._

This catch is in my opinion superior to the one now used, which is
a piece of wood nailed to the far side of the off cheek, with an
opening in it, through which a sloping piece projects beyond the
front of the cheek, for the bar to slide up. The old one appears much
easier to justify, by means of the screw, without having any nails to
draw.

In very fine press work, where uniformity of pressure is to be
preserved, I would always cheek the bar, or bring it home, every
pull, and rest a short time upon it. In large forms, however, this
is too much exertion for a man to continue; and to obviate this
objection I had a catch made for some wooden presses, which, dropping
over the bar, held it close to the cheek, and enabled the pressman to
rest upon his pull sufficiently long without the continued strain to
his arm. It was screwed to the near cheek, and disengaged from the
press bar, by pulling a piece of string attached to its other end
through the small hole.

CATCH WORD.

The first word of the following page set at the right hand end of
the line of quadrats at the foot of each page; in which line is
also placed the signature in those pages where it is requisite. It
is likewise called the _Direction Word_. Catch words are now seldom
used, except in reprints, to preserve uniformity in the different
editions of the same work.

CATER CORNER.

Paper, the sides of which are not at right angles with each other, is
termed _cater cornered_. It is disadvantageous for book work, as it
cannot be folded even, nor the outside margin made equal; of course
the size of the book must be reduced in the binding to make the fore
edge and foot of it smooth.

CERTIFICATE.

By the act of the 39th Geo. 3. cap. 79., intituled “An Act for the
more effectual Suppression of Societies established for Seditious
and Treasonable Purposes; and for better preventing Treasonable and
Seditious Practices,” it is enacted--

  a. 23. “And whereas many Societies, established of late Years
  for treasonable and seditious Purposes, and especially the said
  Societies of _United Englishmen_, _United Scotsmen_, _United
  Irishmen_, and _United Britons_, and the said Society called
  _The London Corresponding Society_, and other Corresponding
  Societies, have at various Times caused to be published, in great
  Quantities, divers printed Papers of an irreligious, treasonable,
  and seditious Nature, tending to revile our holy Religion, and to
  bring the Profession and Worship thereof into Contempt among the
  Ignorant, and also to excite Hatred and Contempt of his Majesty’s
  Royal Person, Government, and Laws, and of the happy Constitution
  of these Realms, as by Law established, and utterly to eradicate
  all Principles of Religion and Morality; and such Societies have
  dispersed such printed Papers among the lower Classes of the
  Community, either _gratis_, or at very low Prices, and with an
  Activity and Profusion beyond all former Example: And whereas all
  Persons printing or publishing any Papers or Writings are by Law
  answerable for the Contents thereof, but such Responsibility hath

CHAPEL.

Every printing office is called a chapel. The term is supposed to
have had its origin from the first introduction of printing into
England by Caxton, who executed his works in a chapel adjoining
Westminster Abbey. Moxon however gives a different account, for which
_see_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

A chapel, in the technical sense of the word, is when the workmen
agree to certain rules for the good order of the printing office.

All the compositors in a composing room, and all the pressmen in a
press room, who are journeymen, form the chapel in each department,
(for they seldom unite,) in which one of the number is elected,
during pleasure, as president, or _The Father_, as he is styled.
In their assembled body they enjoin regulations, and enforce their
due observance; they also take cognizance of any disputes, and any
grievance that may be complained of, that arise within the chapel,
when called upon for that purpose; and there is no appeal from their
decision.

The chapel is in general sanctioned by the master printer, on
account of some of the rules tending to the preservation of his
property;--such as the infliction of a fine on any one connected with
the house leaving the premises without putting out his candle or
leaving it in charge, or for throwing types, quadrats, or furniture,
at another; and for the regular despatch of business, so far as
regards the forwarding of work in general--but in addition the
workmen make particular regulations for themselves, with regard to
their own mode of working in companionship, &c. The chapel will also,
if appealed to, enforce these bye laws, if I may so term them.

The fine for leaving a candle burning, is, I believe, never remitted;
it is generally sixpence for a workman, double for the overseer, and
half a crown for the master of the house.

The person who first sees the candle extinguishes it and delivers
the candlestick to the Father, who keeps it till the fine is either
paid, or promised to be paid; for Monday is the regular pay day in a
printing office.

There are frequently a number of devices resorted to to induce a
workman to go out after the candles are lighted, for the sake of the
fine--the open air being the boundary--such as saying, a person is
below who wants to speak to Mr. ----; this is usually avoided by the
party giving his candle in charge; that is, saying to some one, _Mr.
----, take charge of my candle_. This person then becomes responsible
for the charge as well as for his own candle, and has to pay for both
should he leave the house without putting them out, or giving them in
charge to some other person.

I have previously said that the office of Father is during pleasure,
although I am aware that Mr. Hansard, in his Typographia, has stated
it to be otherwise; but I have known instances of the Father being
deposed, after having held the office for many years, and a successor
appointed and deposed within a fortnight, merely for the sake of the
initiatory fine, which is usually a gallon of porter. These instances
have occurred when a flush of business caused an additional number
of men to be employed in a printing office; some of whom being of a
thoughtless disposition, and thinking they could outvote the sedate
and the sober part of the workmen, call a chapel for the most trivial
purposes, which thus becomes a hinderance to business, as it takes
the whole of the men from their work.

But this evil produces its own remedy, when it is carried to too
great an extent. Workmen get tired of being called from their
employment, and losing time continually, on trifling objects in which
they feel no interest: and they check the evil by fining those who
call the chapel, when it is evident that liquor is the motive for
calling it.

I remember an instance when calling chapels had become a grievance
from their frequency, in which the party was so completely checked,
that he never ventured to call another. It occurred during a flush
of work, when there were temporary hands employed, some of whom were
partial to liquor, and eager to fine any one in order to obtain it.
After deposing the Father two or three times, and calling chapels
many times unnecessarily, a person left his candle burning one
evening, and another passing his frame observed, _Here’s a candle
left; whose is it?_ The reply was, Mr.----’s.--_If I had known that,
I would have put it out._ This was sufficient to bring the individual
before the chapel, as it was held to be an attempt to defraud it of
its due, of which the chapel is very jealous. Well, a chapel was
called to take cognizance of the charge, without a doubt that they
should levy a good fine for what they looked on as a great offence:
but the established workmen of the house, and some of the additional
men, had got tired of these repeated calls from their employment; and
it being proved in the defence, that a party in the house had been
for some time expressing a desire to fine this individual, who was of
a warm temper, and had brought a charge against him for a thoughtless
expression that was not acted on, the chapel decided that it was a
conspiracy against him, acquitted him, and laid a heavy fine upon the
accuser.

No person but the Father can call a chapel, which is generally held
at the imposing stone: and when any one wishes to appeal to it, he
notifies the same to the Father, stating the objects generally, and
accompanying the notification with a penny. The Father will sometimes
decline to call the chapel, where the object appears trivial; but if
the notification be accompanied with the value of a gallon of porter,
it is imperative on him to call it, under the penalty of being
deposed.

The chapel never assembles without the fee of a gallon of porter, in
addition to the fine it may impose; and this fee is always paid, even
when it assembles to settle any disputed matter between workmen, when
no fine is levied.

If any workman refuses to attend when a chapel is summoned, after
being called on by the Father for that purpose, the first business is
to proceed to judgment on him for contumacy, which is always punished
by a fine;--the chapel then proceeds to the business for which it
was called, and when the members cannot agree in their decision,
or when the matter becomes personal, they decide by chalking. For
this purpose, a large galley is placed on a frame, in that part of
the room which is most private and cannot be overlooked, and a line
drawn down the middle of it, and at the top over each column is
written _for_ and _against_, or _yes_ and _no_; one of the members
then makes a mark, usually on the lenient side, which saves him from
ill will, as it must be known on which side he gives his decision;
the second generally marks the contrary side, so that the following
persons cannot discover how any have voted. The Father, when all have
chalked, examines the number on each side, and declares the judgment
of the chapel.

It is an invariable rule that the chapel can do no wrong; and it is
a crime to find fault with its decisions, which it would certainly
punish with a fine if called on for that purpose, and the case was
proved. All wagers of half a gallon of porter, or more, go to the
chapel, so that they are never evaded, as the liquor is sent for by
the chapel, which adjudges who shall pay for it: the consequence is,
that when the object is to obtain drink, and perhaps a young man
from the country to act on, who is ignorant of the London customs,
the cases are often of the most preposterous kind; for instance,
an experienced hand has been known to assert in such a case that a
mallet was a planer, and to call it by that name, and then offer
a wager, in support of his assertion, to the young man, who has
accepted it. The chapel decided that it was a planer, and the
stranger had to pay for summoning the chapel, and also the amount of
the wager, by way of initiation.

The chapel also decides all disputes that may arise in the house, as
well private, if it be appealed to, as those which may arise when
two or more are employed on the same piece of work, and frequently
fixes the price which shall be paid for it; for in doubtful cases a
workman will prefer taking the collective opinion of his fellows, to
acting on his own judgment, as it may affect them all. In this case
the person who is on the work must not take less than the chapel
fixes, without permission; and if the employer will not pay it, he,
of course, must quit his situation. If, after the chapel has fixed
a price for a piece of work, a man should venture to do it for a
reduced price, he becomes a “Rat.”

In a press room there is sometimes a fine for men throwing water at
each other, which dirties and spoils the paper;--and in hot summer
weather, when a man has been desirous of a draught of porter, an
instance has been known of his falling down in a pretended fit, and
when another in kindness has procured some cold water and sprinkled
his face with it, the other has jumped up and accused him of throwing
water at him, on which he has had to pay the fine.

If any member of the chapel should be hardy enough to oppose its
decisions, there are a number of ways practised to bring him, and
even the most obstinate, to submission. Every chapel is haunted by an
imaginary spirit, named Ralph; and when any person refuses to obey
its mandates, this spirit begins to _walk_, as it is termed. The
first act is, in general, to hide the offender’s composing stick;
if this does not answer, his galleys are secreted; then the page
cords, which secure his work, are cut, and his labour rendered more
than useless, because he has to distribute his pie as well as to
recompose his matter; if he still remains contumacious, the whole
of the types in his cases are transposed, so that he cannot proceed
in his business; and if he should still set the chapel at defiance,
he is smoked, all the members of the chapel surrounding his frame,
each with a lighted match of brimstone, and singing a doleful ditty;
after this he is sent to Coventry, and every man becomes amenable to
the chapel, if he assists him, gives him any information, or speaks
to him; so that he must either submit to the penalties inflicted, or
leave the house. When he submits, his apparatus is restored, and the
types properly arranged again in his cases.

Apprentices never belong to the chapel; neither is the master of the
house, nor the overseer, ever allowed to be present when one is held.

Many master printers are decidedly against chapels, as tending to
encourage drinking, and the neglect of business; where this has been
the case within my knowledge, the grievance has remedied itself,
for the sober and industrious prevent the evil going to an extreme;
and where there are a number of men employed, the majority will be
found opposed to being called from their work repeatedly to decide on
fractious or quibbling questions, in which they feel no interest;
and by fining a busy meddling person, they put a stop to the frequent
calling of chapels, which, as I have said before, are, generally
speaking, promoted by temporary workmen, who seldom stop long in
a house, and on whose departure the business is carried on in the
regular manner, while, if one or two continue to work in the house,
they soon fall into the old customs of the permanent men; for among
the established workmen of a house chapels are seldom called.

It has also been objected to them that they tend to excite an
opposition to the employer on the question of wages. This may have
happened; but wherever I have seen a question respecting prices
brought before a chapel, I have always seen it discussed in a fair
manner, and the value estimated impartially,--the scale being kept
in view for any thing nearly similar;--for among a number of workmen
there will always be found men of principle, who would not sanction
an unreasonable demand for the temporary advantage of a few shillings
a week; and these men have always great influence in the decision.

Upon the whole, when I take into account the decreased risk from
fire, owing to the fine for candles--the prevention of waste of
materials, by throwing them about--the appeal for wrongs done in
companionships, or for neglect, or throwing impediments in the way
of business, and remedying them--I am of opinion that the advantages
attending chapels outweigh their disadvantages, and that the business
is carried on with more regularity and promptitude with them than
without them, particularly when it is taken into account that the
rules and regulations laid down by the employer for the governing of
his house, are adopted by the workmen and become chapel laws.

As many of the customs of chapels are passing away, I have been
rather more diffuse in this article than the mere definition of the
term might seem to require; but as I am not aware that any preceding
writer has explained a chapel, I have been led to do so, that the
knowledge of old customs might not be entirely lost. _See_ RULES.


CHAPEL LAWS.

The regulations adopted by the men in chapel assembled, for
preserving good order in the office, are called chapel laws.


CHARGE,

             { paper with great pages.
  is to fill { a page with long and many lines.
             { a line with many letters.--_M._

This term is not in general use: we are more in the custom of saying
a full sheet, a full page, a full line.


CHARITABLE DONATIONS. _See_ DONATIONS.


CHASE.

An iron frame to fasten types in to print with.--_M._

A great revolution has taken place with respect to chases. They were
formerly made thin and narrow, but are now made thicker, which gives
more safety to a form in quoining; and they are made much broader,
both in the rim and the crosses, which adds to their strength and
durability.

It is customary to dovetail the crosses into the rim of wrought iron
chases, and to have mortises for duodecimos and eighteens, so as to
move the crosses according to the size of the work for which the
chase is wanted. This plan is convenient in many instances, but it is
in many others inconvenient and wasteful.

It is necessary to have chases in an office with the crosses loose,
to a limited extent, as they could not well be dispensed with on many
occasions; but I would have as few as possible; for the mortises
in the rim cut the quoins to pieces, and the loose crosses are
frequently used for pokers, and for tightening quoins in forms when
they get slack. By these means they are bent and destroyed, and
the chases to which they belong are rendered nearly useless. The
loose crosses have also another disadvantage: they frequently get
mislaid or lost when taken out for folios, or broadsides, and when
the chase is wanted for any other size, the cross cannot be found,
and the compositor, or person who has the care of the furniture, is
obliged to take such a cross as he can meet with, and which he can
drive into the mortises with a mallet; this cross is sometimes of a
different thickness from the right one, and affects the register of
the pages in working, particularly if the furniture and the chase be
transposed, as too frequently occurs through carelessness.

There is less waste and destruction when the crosses are rivetted
into the rim; for the chases are then always ready for use--the
crosses can never be mislaid nor destroyed--and the whole implement
is much more durable than when the parts are separate.

Cast iron chases are now coming greatly into use, and answer the
purpose very well. The crosses are fast, the whole chase being cast
in one piece, so that there must be chases for each size, viz.
folios, quartos, and duodecimos; the crosses fixed for these sizes
will answer every other, except broadsides. They are cast from a card
chase to the largest size; and stand locking up and the usual wear,
without breaking. These chases are much cheaper than those made of
wrought iron.

There are some chases now made with the inside of the rim bevelled
off from the cross to the angle, to answer the purpose of sidesticks
and footsticks; a piece of broad, or narrow, being used at the sides
and feet of the pages. This plan appears to be economical with regard
to furniture.

The usual practice in cutting chases for 18mo. is to place the long
cross about one third of the width from one of the sides of the
chase, and two thirds from the other, for the purpose of making it
fall in one of the backs; by this mode one of the quarters in the
offcut has only two pages in it, so as hardly to admit of quoin room,
the other has four; and the remainder of the form is also divided
unequally, one side of the long cross having four pages, and the
other eight pages. This method of imposing an 18mo. is inconvenient,
and the large quarter is in danger of falling out. The plan appears
to have been adopted merely to cause the long cross to fall in one
of the backs, which is of no consequence whatever. I have always
imposed eighteens in chases cut for 12mo. which I prefer; for the
quarters being more equal, make the locking up more secure, and the
only difference in the imposition is, that the long cross falls in a
gutter, instead of a back.

Mr. T. C. Hansard took out a patent for “Improvements on, and
Additions to, Printing Presses, and various Processes relative to
Printing.” Among the different articles are chases, which Mr. Hansard
thus describes:--“The Demi- (or half-) Chases are made so as to
contain the pages imposed within a less measure of square than usual.
One side of the rim is made particularly straight, and rather less
in breadth than the other three sides: this narrow side forms the
part to lie in the middle of the Table of the Press: by turning a
pair of chases so made on contrary faces, the two narrow sides will
join and form as one chase. The pages are not in these chases, as in
others for all sizes above Folios, locked-up by having side sticks
and quoins on all four sides, but only on one side, and at each end.
The inner Forme being locked up on the right side only, and at each
end, and the outer Forme on the left side only, and at each end; and
the margin being made when the two demi-chases are laid together on
the Imposing Stone, as if the same were one large chase of double
dimensions, the pages will require no more margin in the centre of
the double sheet, than a fair equal proportion for the division of
margin. The chases must be made in proportion to the size of the work
intended to be executed.”


CHEEKS.

The upright sides of a printing press.--_M._


CHEEK THE BAR.

Pulling the bar of the press till it touches the near cheek. In good
work I would always have the pull so justified that when the bar
was pulled home, or cheeked, it should occasion the proper degree
of pressure of the platen upon the form; this would in some degree
assist in procuring equal impressions through all the copies printed;
but in heavy or large forms it would be too great an exertion for
the pressman to continue doing without some assistance, as such work
requires to rest on the pull. I adopted a catch for the bar when
cheeked, in some presses, which completely answered the purpose, and
enabled the pressman to rest on his pull as long as was necessary,
without overstraining his arms. _See_ CATCH OF THE BAR.


CHEMISTRY. _See_ ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES. FORMULÆ, CHEMICAL.


CHOKE.

If a form be not washed in due time, the ink will get into the
hollows of the face of the letter: and that getting in of the ink is
called Choking of the Letter, or Choking of the Form--_M._ It is also
said, the letter is choked with ink, or the form is choked with ink,
when too much is used.

of a sheep’s foot. The end to draw the ball nails out of the ball
stocks.--_M._


CLAWS, for Stereotype Risers. _See_ RISERS.


CLEAN PROOF.

When a proof has but few faults in it, it is called a _Clean
Proof_.--_M._ It is also called a clean proof when it is printed
after being corrected, to be sent out, or to be read for press--that
is, the pressmen take more care in printing it, and keep the margins
clean.


CLEAN SHEETS.

Authors and publishers have generally one copy of each sheet of a
work sent to them as it is printed, for the purpose of reference,
and to see the progress of the work; these copies are called _clean
sheets_. _See_ TOPS.


CLEARING AWAY.

When a work is completed, clearing away is the distributing of
headlines, chapters, lines of small capitals, and other useful sorts,
taking the lines of quadrats away, and tying up the remainder of the
matter in moderate sized pieces with old page cord, so as to be ready
to be papered up; and tying the furniture, reglets, and leads up, and
delivering them to the proper person, who takes charge of them.

The compositor, after laying up the form to be cleared away and
washing it well--and matter ought never to be cleared away without
undergoing this process--takes a page into a galley--an old one
generally--and picks out the leads, if it be leaded matter; he will
then push the matter up from the foot and put another page on his
galley, and take the leads out of it also; he will then take the
headlines away, and put them on another galley; then take the lines
of quadrats and reglets out, and put them on a paper under his frame,
then the chapters, contents of chapters, any lines with words of
Greek, or other useful sorts, and, after pushing the matter close
up together, he will tie it firmly up, in pieces rather longer than
a full sized octavo page, and if a short line happens to fall at
the bottom, put it in some other situation, so that the top and the
bottom shall be full lines. He will thus proceed, till his sheet or
other quantity be all tied up, taking care to make his pieces of
equal lengths, for the convenience of piling them up in the letter
closet.

If the work should be in very small pages, so that two in width would
not be wider than a large octavo page, he will put two together, side
by side, to prevent papering the matter up in long narrow slips.

Having tied all the matter up for papering, he will either place it
on a board in a rack, or put it in some other place where cleared
away matter is usually deposited till papered up; he will then
distribute his headlines, chapters, contents, and other useful sorts
into their proper places; and if there be not room in the cases for
the quadrats, he will put them into the proper drawers in which the
surplus quadrats are kept.

If the work be in folio or quarto, he will tie it up in
proportionally sized pieces.

He will then tie up his leads; and if there be any of different
thicknesses, he will, of course, assort them, and tie them up
separately: he takes a moderate quantity, if they be octavo leads,
rather more than the length of a page of matter, and places a piece
of reglet at each end of it, to guard the outside leads from injury
by the tightening of the cord, and making a slip knot at one end of a
piece of old page cord, he places the leads in the noose, and draws
it as tight as the cord will bear, then turns the leads over upon the
spare cord and draws it tight; he thus proceeds turning the leads
over upon the spare cord, and drawing it tight, till he has got turns
sufficient round the leads to secure them, and tucks in the end of
the cord under the turns two or three times, drawing it tight; he
knocks up the ends of the leads upon the imposing stone, gently, not
to injure them, and when he has thus tied them all up, he puts them
along with his matter.

He ties his reglets up in the same manner, and puts them with the
leads.

He puts the quoins into the quoin drawer.

He inquires of the proper person whether the furniture is to be tied
up, or put into the drawers; if the latter, he assorts it--side and
foot sticks, gutters, broads, narrows, reglets, and scaleboards, and
puts each into its separate drawer; if it be to be tied up, he puts
the scaleboard into its proper drawer, and arranges the others neatly
and ties them firmly together with old page cord, and delivers them
and the chases to the proper person, who may be either the overseer,
or some person appointed to take care of the materials.


CLEARING PIE.

To separate from each other in the confused mass, and assort the
different kinds and sizes of types, and to distribute them into their
respective cases; if there be a large quantity of any particular
fount, or founts, it is usual to compose them into pages, and, if the
letter be not wanted, to paper it up; when that fount is brought into
use, a proportionate quantity of pie is given to each compositor to
distribute.

This is generally the work of the apprentices during any slackness of
business. A quantity of pie is placed on the imposing stone, or, if
that cannot be spared for the purpose, on a letter board upon a bulk,
and each fount is separated from the other; they are then composed
into lines, and either distributed or papered up: although it may
appear a roundabout way to compose it, it in reality saves time, as
the composed matter is distributed with greater facility. In large
establishments the reading boys assort pie at their leisure time.


CLEARING STONE.

It is a general rule that every person shall, under a penalty, after
imposing or correcting, leave a clear stone; that is, the mallet,
shooting-stick, furniture, quoins, saw, sawblock, and shears, are to
be put in their proper places; any good letters that may be scattered
about, distributed; and the bad letters put into the shoe, so that
there shall be no impediment to the next person using it. Any of the
articles used, or two letters, left on it will render him liable to
the fine.


CLICKER.

The compositor who, in a companionship, receives the copy from the
overseer or other person, gives it out to compose, receives the
matter back when composed, keeps an account of what each person does,
sets the head and direction lines, and the notes if any, makes up
the pages, lays them down on the imposing stone, and makes out the
account, apportioning to each his proper share; his own share of the
bill being always equal with the highest: this refers to working
on lines. In other companionships he receives the copy from the
overseer, distributes it to his companions, and receives instructions
how the work is to be done.


CLOSE MATTER.

Matter with few breaks or whites--_M._ The term is now understood of
works that are not leaded. _See_ BAD WORK.


CLOSE SPACING.

This term is used when only a middling space is put between words,
and sometimes a thin space; for some authors will not allow words to
have much space between them, but only just enough to separate them
from each other, in which case a thick space is never exceeded.

CLYMER’S PRESS.

Mr. George Clymer, of Philadelphia, first began to turn his attention
to the improvement of the printing press in the year 1797. Having
completed his object, he came to England in 1817, and introduced his
improved press under the name of the Columbian Press: he established
a manufactory in London, and the first press he constructed here
was completed in 1818, and I believe went to Russia. It is an iron
press; there is no screw; the head is a large and powerful lever,
which is acted on by other levers to which the bar is attached, and
produces the pressure; the platen is attached to the head by a square
bar of iron, and the descent is preserved steadily and regularly by
two projecting guides, one from each cheek; the platen is raised
from the form by a lever with a weight at one end, attached to and
above the head, which acts when the pull is eased and the bar flies
back. The power of this press is very great, and I have not heard of
any failing or breaking, which is an important fact in its favour.
It ranks in the opinion of practical men, generally, as the next in
estimation to the Stanhope press. The only objection I have heard to
this press, was the length that the pressmen had to reach, and the
disadvantage in the pull, by the bar being attached to the off cheek;
but Mr. Clymer remedied this by attaching it to the near cheek, which
not only facilitates the pull, but also enables the pressman to exert
his strength more advantageously and with more ease. Mr. Clymer died
in 1834, but the manufactory is still continued in Finsbury Street
under the firm of Clymer and Dixon. I believe the representative of
Mr. Clymer is Mr. A. R. Shaw, who married one of his daughters.


COCK-UP LETTER.

It is not unusual to begin a work, and the divisions of it, as Parts,
or Books, with the first word set in capitals, and the first letter
a larger capital, justified to range at the foot with the others,
and bearing about the same proportion to them that capitals bear to
their own small capitals; whatever proportion there may be between
the first letter and the other part of the word, if it be justified
to range at the foot, it is styled a Cock-up Letter.


COFFIN.

That part of a wooden press, in which the stone is bedded.

Type Founders usually send small quantities of sorts in brown paper
made into a cone, and twisted at the small end, similar in shape to
what grocers use for small articles; where there are no fount cases,
or where they are full, compositors do the same with superfluous
sorts; these conical papers are called _Coffins_.

The frame and bottom of a slice galley, into which the slice slides,
is also called the coffin. _See_ GALLEY.


COGGER’S PRESS.

The cheeks of this press are of wrought iron, the head is of cast
iron, very strong, and secured in its place by screws and nuts, and
appears sufficient to bear the greatest power that can be applied
in the ordinary process of printing, without injury. The pressure
is obtained by a spindle with a screw working in the head, and
at the bottom of it is a collar in which are fixed two studs of
case-hardened iron with convex faces, which act upon two inclined
planes of unequal degree of inclination; so that, when the platen
first begins to descend, the descent is quick, but as the platen
reaches the point of pressure, the velocity is diminished and the
power proportionably increased, till arriving at a part of the plane
nearly horizontal, and the levers taking the most advantageous
positions, the highest degree of pressure is obtained. The inclined
planes are of hard steel, dovetailed in the bottom of a circular
brass box resting on the centre of the top of the platen; it contains
oil, so that the studs dip into it every pull. The power is obtained
by the bar being attached to a multiplied cross arm lever. Should the
inclined planes break, or be injured, they can easily be taken out
and replaced with new ones.


COLLATE.

To examine the signatures in each gathering, to see that they are
right and perfect. Moxon styles it COLLATION BOOKS.

The person who has to collate, (generally the Warehouseman, as he is
answerable for the correctness of the delivery of books,) takes a
heap of a gathering and places the first or signature page uppermost,
towards his right hand, and with the point of a sharp bodkin, or a
penknife, picks up the corner of each sheet, in order to see that
each signature is right, passing his thumb under them as they rise,
to keep what he examines separate from the heap, and thus proceeds
till he has examined one gathering; he then slips this gathering a
little back on the heap, and proceeds with another, till he has gone
through eight or ten, which he turns over to his left hand upon the
table, where they are ready to fold; and he thus proceeds till he has
collated a sufficient number for his delivery, or the whole number of
the work, as the case may require.

In the course of his progress he will find some sheets laid the wrong
way, these he puts right; in some cases the boys will have taken
two sheets of the same signature up, he takes one of these out; in
other cases, there may be duplicate signatures, and the right one in
order wanting; he calls out to the gathering boys to give him the
right sheet, and draws out the duplicate as before, and sometimes
a signature is wanting, which he also calls for. In these cases
the wrong sheets that are taken out of the gathering are called
_Drawn Sheets_, and are laid down on their respective heaps, to be
re-gathered.

Although not customary, I have known a warehouseman use neither a
bodkin nor a penknife, but slip up the corner of the sheet with the
end of his forefinger, in order to examine the signatures: any one
who adopts this practice should be particularly careful to have clean
fingers, or he will soil the corners of many sheets, and disfigure
his work.

COLOURS.

In Hayter’s “Introduction to Perspective Drawing and Painting,” is
a diagram of the three primitive colours, with their combinations,
which show the best contrasts. He says, this is highly useful for
a painter to understand: and I think it is highly useful for a
printer also to understand; for it will enable him to make the best
disposition of colours in printing so as always to produce a superior
effect to what could be done without the guidance of a correct
principle. I shall give the passage.

[Illustration: Three overlapping circles]

“You may try another experiment in proof of the primitive superiority
of red, yellow, and blue, over all other colours. First draw a
circle; then, with the same opening of the compasses, set one foot
on the circumferent line, and draw a second circle; and again, with
one foot of the compasses on the point where the two circles bisect,
draw a third; cover one whole circle with yellow, another with red,
and another with blue (letting each dry before you lay the next);
the colours intermixing by the equilateral intersection of the three
circles, will produce green, orange, and purple; and the central
portion, taking all the three colours, will be neutral of the black
class, and nearly black, according to the strength of the three
separate lays of the primitive colours. By this diagram you will
have a certain proof of the colours which are most adapted to oppose
each other, from which the knowledge of their harmonizing properties
may be derived. You will find a primitive colour always opposite to
a compound one; as, BLUE will be opposite _orange_, RED opposite
_green_, and YELLOW opposite _purple_; which must determine them to
be the natural opposites: this is highly useful for a painter to
understand.”

Coming down the form.

Two pressmen working at the same press call one another

of work also call each other Companions. Both parties frequently
abbreviate the word, and call each other Comp.


COMPANIONSHIP.

When more than one compositor is employed upon any work it is styled
a companionship.

There are different ways of working in companionships: one is, for
each to work on his own account, to write his own bill, charging
what he has done, and correct his own matter. At other times all the
individuals work is charged and received in gross in the name of the
companionship, and the division into the respective earning of each
is made by the clicker.

In this case, to prevent unfairness, arising from any of the
companions taking an undue advantage over the others, the copy
should be strictly kept from their inspection, and a stated quantity
invariably given out for each when any of them are out of copy, and
not before; by this means each of them will have an equal chance for
any fat that may occur. I have found in practice this method to be
the fairest for all the individuals.

Another method is working on time or in pocket, where each individual
exerts himself to further the work in any way that appears to the
clicker the best, either composing or correcting, as the case
requires. In this form of companionship the whole of what is done
is written in one bill, and equally divided among the companions,
provided they have been punctual in their attendance, and have not
taken more than the prescribed time for their meals, &c.; otherwise
they are subject to fines for infraction of the rules agreed to for
their guidance.

As it often happens that a work is required to be printed with
the greatest possible despatch, the plan of working upon Lines
is frequently adopted, which is found in practice to be the most
expeditious method of facilitating the work at case.

As soon as a work that requires despatch is put in hand, the overseer
selects such men as are able to complete a great quantity of work in
a given time, and appoints one of them who thoroughly understands
his business, and is in other respects qualified, to undertake the
management of the work, and to do every thing which would interfere
with the regular business of distributing, composing and correcting.
This person is styled the clicker.

While the companionship proceeds to the distribution of letter, the
clicker applies to the overseer for the copy, receives instructions
respecting it, and procures leads and every other necessary sort. He
then draws out a table in the following form, or something similar.

In the first column he sets down the name of each compositor when
he takes copy; and in the second the folio of the copy, that he
may be able to ascertain instantly in whose hands it lies. In the
third column he notes down the number of lines each man has composed
opposite to his name, as fast as the galleys are brought to him. In
the fourth he sets down such remarks respecting the copy, &c. as
may be necessary, and also any circumstance that may occur in the
companionship.

  +-------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
  | Compositors | Folios of |   Lines   | Memoranda. |
  |    Names.   |   Copy.   | composed. |            |
  +-------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
  |             |           |           |            |
  |             |           |           |            |
  |             |           |           |            |
  |             |           |           |            |
  +-------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

When the members of the companionship are ready for their first
taking of copy, they are to receive it from the clicker in small
quantities, taking care that the two first have shorter takings than
any of the others, to prevent as much as possible any delay in the
making up. During the time the first taking is in hand, the clicker
sets the head, the head lines, white lines, signature lines, together
with side notes, and other extraneous matter.

As soon as the first person brings him his matter, he counts the
number of lines, and inserts it in the table; he then gives him
another taking of copy, and proceeds with the making up. The same
plan is observed with the rest of the companionship.

When the first sheet is made up, he lays the pages on the stone, and
informs the overseer of it, who will then immediately provide chases
and furniture.

The work will now proceed rapidly, provided there be no hinderance
with respect to letter, &c. If the clicker find that he cannot make
up the matter as fast as it is composed, he should call the companion
who is last in copy to his assistance. In this case the clicker
counts the lines he has composed, sets them down in the table, and
takes notice of the time he is off, which is to be made up to him by
a deduction from the share of each person.

The proofs should be read immediately after they are pulled, and
given to the clicker to be corrected. As soon as this is done, he
gives the proof to the compositor whose matter stands first, who
should immediately lay up the forms and correct his matter, then
forward it to the next, and so on, till the sheet be corrected; the
compositor whose matter is last in the sheet then locks it up, and
carries the forms to the proof press.

As soon as one of the companionship is out of copy, and there is no
more to be given out, the lines of the whole must be counted off,
and set down in the table, and then every one does as much as he can
for the general benefit. If there be not work enough to employ the
whole, those who are not wanted may go to their regular work, and the
time of their absence, till the rest of the companionship return to
theirs, will be deducted from their respective shares.

In the outset the value of the lines is calculated, so that each of
the companionship shall be paid, in the first instance, for what
he composes: the head and direction lines, the white lines, the
branching out, the short pages, and the white pages, are termed fat;
these the clicker sets, they are included in the general account,
and the amount divided among the companionship. By this means each
compositor will receive a share of the whole, according to the
number of lines he composes, and an equal share of the fat, and the
clicker’s share of the bill must be equal to that of the person who
has set the greatest number of lines.

If leads, or any other materials, run short, a clever and active
clicker will not wait for a supply from the overseer, who may be
prevented attending to him at the moment, but will immediately forage
for them himself, well knowing that expediting the work is for his
own advantage as well as for that of the companionship.

Those companions who do not compose half as many lines as the
compositor who has the greatest number, receive only a share of the
fat equal to one half of what those do who have worked regularly; and
those who do not compose more than one quarter, only receive equal to
one quarter of a regular share.


COMPARATIVE SIZE OF TYPES. _See_ TYPES.


COMPOSING.

The term composing includes the practical knowledge of picking up
letters, spacing, justifying lines, and emptying the composing stick
when full.

Although expedition is a most desirable qualification in a
compositor, yet alone it is far from constituting a good workman:
and the man who possesses no other claims to the title will be found
competent to little more than setting reprints, in which no judgment
is required, and where he has only to arrange letter for letter,
point for point, and line for line; on which employment he may
whistle, sing, talk, or laugh, without inconvenience to himself; for
the process being merely mechanical, and the mind not being occupied
in the smallest degree, if he make a mistake of a word, it will be
detected at the end of the line; or, if there be a double, or an out,
of lines, either will be detected when the page is finished.

How different is the case with the man who is anxious to deserve the
title of a good workman, and to maintain it: in his youth he has been
equally desirous with the other to acquire expedition; and, having
attained it, he has felt that other requisites were necessary;--he
has read, to obtain information--he has examined the best
workmanship, as specimens for his guidance--he endeavours to compose
accurately--he is careful and uniform in his spacing--he justifies
his lines to an equal tightness--he divides his words, when necessary
to divide them, correctly, and with a regard to appearance--and when
occasional bits of rule work occur, they are marked by a degree of
neatness in being cut to precise lengths, and in the corners fitting
with precision--in all the work that passes through his hands there
appear the marks of attention and skill.

When a master printer undertakes a work which requires more than
ordinary care, and is difficult to execute, the superiority of the
man who has endeavoured to improve himself is evident: he is selected
to perform it; and he then feels the advantage of his perseverance.
At work upon a difficult subject, with an ill written manuscript,
his first proofs show him equal to the task--his arrangements of the
matter are judicious--his punctuation is correct--when particular
sorts are to be justified, they are done with accuracy--when an
accented letter is required that cannot be procured in a single
type, he makes it with neatness--and when his proof returns from
the reader, he will frequently correct it in as little time, as a
slovenly compositor will require to correct a proof of a similar
size, that is a reprint.

The results to the slovenly and the good compositor are very
different. The first is only employed during a flush of work; when
that ceases, he has to seek fresh employment; perhaps does not meet
with any for some weeks; again obtains a temporary engagement; and
thus continues, till old age approaches, and he is rendered incapable
of working. The good workman, on the contrary, is prized by his
employer, especially if the latter be a workman himself, and a man of
judgment. He is looked up to by his fellow-workmen; his situation is
permanent, if he choose; his abilities qualify him to be a reader,
and if his mind lead him that way, he may obtain such a situation.
His knowledge and his merit fit him to become the overseer of a large
house; where he has many advantages, and where he continues with
credit to himself: unless, perhaps, he chooses to commence business
on his own account, which is frequently done, when he invariably
obtains the countenance and support of those who have witnessed his
skill, his knowledge, his attention, and his industry.

There is another class of compositors who neither possess much skill;
nor are very expeditious: I mean such as are of a sober, steady
habit. These are useful men in an office where there is a number of
reprints; they go on from year to year in a regular routine, and
never step out of it: the employer can always depend on them for a
regular amount of work, if they have sufficient employment.

There are too many, both good and bad workmen, who lose their time in
drinking, gaming, and other vicious and idle pursuits: such persons
pay doubly for their dissipation, for they squander the fruits of
their earnings, and cut off the source of supply, by neglecting their
employment. These men will never be employed in any respectable
printing office, where they are known, except on a temporary
engagement in a case of emergency. They introduce strife and discord
wherever they are, and frequently lead astray the inexperienced
youth: they disregard equally instruction and advice, and are not
awakened to a sense of their condition, till the most severe lessons
in this world are unitedly experienced--old age, poverty, and
contempt.

The mere art of picking up letters, and arranging them in the
composing stick, is looked upon by many compositors as constituting
the whole of their business; who in consequence think that if
they can succeed in picking letters up with facility, they become
first-rate workmen; and the terms “Swifts,” and “Fire Eaters,” by
which expeditious compositors are designated in a printing office,
gratify their vanity.

It is not necessary to give specific rules, and a minute description,
of the manner of picking up each letter, because it is impossible for
them to hold good, the letters lying in every possible direction.
A few general rules may suffice--to take up the letter at that end
where the face is--if the nick be not upwards, to turn it upwards
in its progress to the composing stick--to convey it to the line in
the composing stick with as few motions as possible--to aim at no
flourishes with the hand, which only lose time.

I would advise an inexperienced youth, when he comes to work among a
number of men, to observe the manner of one of the best and quickest
compositors: he will, perhaps, at first conclude that he is looking
at a very slow workman, for the first appearance is fallacious; but
when he examines more closely he will find his mistake, for what he
at first took for slowness is the true principle of expedition; he
will perceive no false motion, which invariably delays progress; the
fingers go to one particular letter, take it up, convey it to the
line direct, while the eye is directed to another letter which the
fingers convey in the same manner to the line; thus letter after
letter accumulate to words, lines, and pages, with a quickness that
looks like magic, while to the spectator it seems to be only the
pace of the tortoise. Let him look at another; there appears all
bustle, all expedition; the body and head in continual motion; the
hand so quick in its evolutions, that he gazes with astonishment on
the apparent rapidity of arranging the letters: let him look again
with more attention, and he will find that the man whom he supposed
so slow makes no mistake, loses no time, but continues steadily and
uniformly making progress: while the other frequently misses taking
hold of his letter; then makes two or three flourishes with his hand
and his head before he takes hold of another; and then his hand
continues dancing and see-sawing, and after three or four of such
motions, made with great rapidity, the letter is finally deposited in
the line. This manner of lifting the letters is in reality the pace
of the tortoise, although it has the appearance of the speed of the
hare.

Regularity of spacing, and a due proportion of distance between
words, contribute in a material degree to improve the appearance of a
book.

When the lines are very short, or the type very large in proportion
to their length, all general rules, both of dividing and spacing,
must give way to necessity; for in such cases it is impossible at all
times to space regularly, or to divide the words correctly.

There is a great diversity of opinion with respect to spacing;
some authors and printers choosing to have the words wide apart,
and others, on the contrary, preferring to have them nearly close
together; the one, requiring an en quadrat, or two thick spaces, and
the other, a thin space only, between the words. Both of these, in my
opinion, go to an extreme: I prefer using a thick space generally,
and justifying with thinner and hair spaces; so that there will
rarely be a necessity for any violent inequality in the distance of
the words from each other.

When a work is double leaded, or has reglet between the lines, it
requires to be wider spaced than when it is solid: in the two first
cases, two middling spaces, or a thick and a thin space, will not be
too much; in the latter, a thick space will be quite sufficient. And
it is necessary to attend to these circumstances; for printing that
is open does not harmonize when close spaced, any more than solid
matter does when wide spaced, which makes it look full of pigeon
holes; for the distance between the words should bear some proportion
to the distance between the lines.

When one or two letters require to be got in, or to be driven out,
the difference between a thick space and a middling one is not
perceptible to the eye, particularly if the compositor is careful to
place the latter before or after a v or w, after a comma that comes
before a v or w, or after a y; and, in like manner, an additional
hair space will not be perceptible if it come after an f, or before a
j; or if it come between db, dh, dk, dl, lb, lh, lk, or ll.

The most expeditious mode of regular spacing, perhaps, is to take the
spaces as they rise; for there being in the box only three sorts, the
thin and the hair spaces being in separate boxes, there will not be
any violent disproportion if the line should be full at the first;
and the slight disproportion may be easily remedied by changing the
situation of two or three: if the line should not be quite full, then
the introduction of a few thin spaces will equalise the distances; or
the substitution of a few thick spaces for middling ones will have
the same effect.

In setting a line of capitals, a careful workman will pay attention
to the bearing off of different letters, for many of them when they
fall together stand as if there were a space between them, and
produce a bad effect: to remedy this inequality, hair spaces, or bits
of paper, are required between those letters that stand close. The
inequality is still greater in many instances in a line of Italic
capitals, and of course requires the same remedy.

It would be desirable, and would tend to facilitate regular spacing,
if there were a greater number of hair spaces cast to a fount than is
now the case.

In poetry, the size of the type and the measure are usually so
arranged as to admit the longest line to come into the measure,
without having occasion to turn it: an opportunity is thus allowed
for regular spacing, which is generally done with thick spaces. When
a work in poetry is commenced, it is usual for the compositor to
divide his space box up the middle with a piece of reglet, or with a
piece of thin wood, made to fit tight, and to assort his thick spaces
on one side, and the thinner on the other, to save time and trouble
in picking them out.

As the measure for poetry is sometimes made as narrow as will
conveniently allow the regular lines to come in, both to save
quadrats, and also to lessen the price of composing, it not
unfrequently happens that a line containing long syllables will not
admit of thick spaces; in this case, the usual practice is to space
close, and get in the line if possible, even with hair spaces, for
turning it is attended with inconveniences; the page must be made up
short, or long, to preserve the couplets, and it affects the next
page, in preventing the stanzas backing each other.

A compositor will always find it advantageous to justify his lines to
an equal tightness; and of this he must be sensible when he has to
lock up his form: if he have been careless in this instance he will
experience a loss of time and find a difficulty in getting his form
to lift; and when it does lift, by means of sticking his bodkin into
quadrats and spaces to tighten those lines that are slack, it will
never be safe; for it is more than probable that many letters will
draw out at press, and cause errors in that sheet, (for pressmen are
generally careless how they replace a letter that has drawn, and,
when it is discovered, they are satisfied if they put it into the
right word,) the pressmen scold the compositor, who also, if he be
working in a companionship, and should not be the last in the sheet,
gets scolded by the compositor who has to lock up the forms, for his
carelessness, and for the additional trouble which it causes.

I would avoid having a lower case f at the end of a line; for, being
a kerned letter, the dot at the end of the curve is almost sure to be
broken off while the sheet is being worked at press.

It is not possible to give particular rules for justifying all the
sorts that occur in many works, and that are not in a printing
office:--for a Ç, it will be necessary to cut away the shank to the
bottom of the face of the letter, and justify a figure of 5 with the
top back dash cut off; a long m̄, n̄, or any other letter, must be
cut away to the upper part of the letter, and a small lower case l,
with the fine lines cut away, fixed flat above; a short y̆ may be
made by taking the bottom of an o; m̃ and ñ by cutting the front of a
small a away, and laying it lengthways; ŵ and ŷ by inverting a lower
case v, after cutting away the cross lines, and making the thick line
equal to the fine one with a sharp knife.

Cutting away the shank allows the additional part to stand close
to the face of the letter, which improves the appearance. In some
instances it will be necessary to cut part of a lead away above the
letter, and justify the addition in the vacancy. The compositor
should, by all means, be careful to justify every sort that is added
so tight as to prevent it from drawing out at press; but not so
tight, as to force the words above and below out of line; in fact,
they ought to be so managed as, when justified to the letter, to
form unitedly its regular body in depth when it is practicable.

The compositor should also be careful to proportion the size of the
accent or mark to be justified to the size of the letter, that there
may be no disproportion between them.

I would recommend to every compositor when he goes to a fresh house,
where it is likely he may work some time, to ascertain what founts
are in the house, with the two line letters, blacks, flowers, &c.:
this knowledge will give him facilities, and enable him to compose
a title, or a job, with less sacrifice of time, than if he were not
acquainted with the materials contained in the office.


COMPOSING RULE.

A piece of brass rule cut to the length of the measure, with a small
ear or beak projecting at one end, by which to take it out. This
rule is laid in the composing stick, and the letters arranged upon
it; when the line is full, the rule is taken out by the projecting
part, and laid upon the line composed, and this process is continued
till the stick is full, when the rule is laid upon the last line as
before, the whole of the matter in the stick is then grasped tight
with both hands, (the rule preventing it from bursting,) taken out of
the stick, and deposited in a galley.


COMPOSING STICK.

The instrument in which the letters are arranged into words and
lines. It is generally made of iron, sometimes of gun metal, and long
ones for large jobs occasionally of wood.

When made of iron it is formed of a piece of sheet iron, one side
turned up nearly half an inch, at a right angle, which forms the
back, and when that is turned to the workman at the right hand
extremity an end is fitted to it, by screws, rivets, or dovetailing:
this end is iron, considerably thicker than the bottom and back, and
is soldered in its place to give it strength and stability.

[Illustration: A composing stick]

There is a slide by which the length of the lines is regularly
justified, which is fixed to the back by a nut and screw passing
through a groove in it, and secured in its place by the screw passing
through one of the holes in the back, by which means the length of
the line can be arranged according to the size of the page. The end
of the stick, and also of the slide, must form a right angle with the
back, and be parallel to each other, otherwise the lines will be of
unequal lengths, and cause much trouble. The English composing sticks
generally hold from nine to eleven lines of pica. The French printers
use much narrower ones, frequently not holding more than three lines.

COMPOSITOR’S BOOK.

To prevent mistakes, confused bills, and disputes in companionships,
and with the employer, it is essentially necessary that a compositor
should keep an account of the work that he does, and it is still
better that he should be able to ascertain on the instant how much he
has composed of any work that he is employed upon; the quantity in
each signature; the number of pages charged, and in what signatures;
and the forms he has imposed, and the signatures. The following form,
it is presumed, will accomplish this object in a simple and easy
manner.

CONDITION.

Balls are said to be in condition, or good condition, when they lug,
and the ink is distributed easily and uniformly on their surface;
that is, when they are neither too hard nor too soft: when they are
either the one or the other, they are said to be in bad condition.
_See_ BALLS. This also applies to rollers.

Paper is said to be in good condition when it has received a proper
degree of moisture, been laid a day or two between the boards or in a
heap, with weights upon the top board, then turned, which changes the
parts is contact, and replaced under the weights for another day, so
that the moisture shall be uniformly diffused and equal through the
whole quantity of paper to be printed.

COPE’S PRESS.

The ALBION. This is the production of Richard Whittaker Cope, and
is an iron press. The power is produced entirely by levers, which,
by means of two strong iron links attached to the head, and working
at the bottom on what is called the lugs, communicate the power to
the platen, and thus produce the impression: on the return of the
bar the platen is lifted from the face of the types by means of a
spiral spring fixed on the head of the press. I have repeatedly
broken the links, when they were guaranteed to withstand any force in
working the press that could be applied to it. On the death of Mr.
Cope, the business was continued by trustees for the benefit of the
family, and is under the immediate management of Mr. John Hopkinson,
who has very much improved this press by taking away the links,
and remodelling it: the principle, on the present construction, is
the same as that of Sherwin and Cope’s Imperial press, with some
variation in the application of the cap or knuckle, and also in the
adjusting wedges, the screw of which to regulate the pull is at the
near side of the piston.


COPTIC.

The Copts are undoubtedly descendants of the ancient Egyptians;
but not an unmixed race, their ancestors in the earlier ages of
Christianity having intermarried with Greeks, Nubians, Abyssinians,
and other foreigners. Their name is correctly pronounced either
_Ckoobt_ or _Ckibt_; but more commonly _Goobt_ or _Gibt_, and (in
Cairo and its neighbourhood, and in some other parts of Egypt,)
_’Oobt_ or _’Ibt_: in the singular, it is pronounced _Ckoob´tee_,
_Ckib´tee_, _Goob´tee_, _Gib´tee_, _’Oob´tee_, or _’Ib´tee_. All
of these sounds bear a great resemblance to the ancient Greek
name of Egypt (Αἰγυπτος): but it is generally believed that the
name of “Ckoobt” is derived from _Coptos_, (once a great city, in
Upper Egypt,) now called _Ckooft_, or, more commonly, _Gooft_; to
which vast numbers of the Christian Egyptians retired during the
persecution with which their sect was visited under several of the
Roman emperors. The Copts have not altogether lost their ancient
language, their liturgy and several of their religious books being
written in it; but the Coptic has become a dead language, understood
by very few persons; and the Arabic has been adopted in its stead.

The Coptic language gradually fell into disuse after the conquest
of Egypt by the Arabs. For two centuries after that event, it
appears to have been the only language that the generality of the
Copts understood; but before the tenth century of our era, most of
the inhabitants of Lower Egypt had ceased to speak and understand
it, [this has been shown by Quatremère, in his Researches on the
Language and Literature of Egypt,] though, in the Sa’ee´d (or Upper
Egypt), El-Muckree´zee tells, the women and children of the Copts,
in his time, (that is, about the close of the fourteenth century
of our era, or the early part of the fifteenth,) scarcely spoke
any other language than the Sa’ee´dee Coptic, and had a complete
knowledge of the Greek. Soon after this period, the Coptic language
fell into disuse in Upper Egypt, as it had done so long before in
the Lower Provinces, and the Arabic was adopted in its stead. All
the Copts who have been instructed at a school still pray, both in
the church and in private, in Coptic; and the Scriptures are still
always read in the churches in that language; but they are explained,
from books, in Arabic. Many books for the use of priests and other
persons are written in the Coptic language expressed in Arabic
characters.--_Lane’s Modern Egyptians_, vol. ii. 1836.

Gibbon states, that Cavio affords a shelter for the indigent
patriarch of the Copts, and a remnant of ten bishops: forty
monasteries have survived the inroads of the Arabs; and the progress
of servitude and apostasy has reduced the Coptic nation to the
despicable number of twenty-five or thirty thousand families.

We know very little of the ancient language of Egypt. Nearly all the
remains of it we now possess, have been transmitted to us through
the Coptic, Sahidic and Bashmuric Dialects. The Coptic Dialect was
spoken in Lower Egypt, of which Memphis was the capital: hence it
has been called, with great propriety, the Memphitic Dialect. The
Sahidic, from the Arabic word _Sahad_, or _Al Sahad_, the _Upper_, or
_Superior_, was the dialect of Upper Egypt, of which Thebes was the
capital; it has, therefore, been called the Thebaïc. It is impossible
to say which of these two dialects was the more ancient. Georgi,
Valperga, Munter, and others, have decided in favour of the Coptic;
and Macriny, Renandot, Lacroze, and Jablonsky, with as much show of
reason, have contended for the Sahidic. Still, however, the question
must be left to conjecture, as we have not sufficient evidence to
enable us to decide upon it. Besides these two dialects, which have
long been known, there was a third, which was spoken in Baschmour, a
province of the Delta.

The existence of three dialects in Egypt has been so satisfactorily
proved by Quatremère, Englebreth, and other writers; and so fully
confirmed by the Bashmuric fragments which have been discovered
and published, that little more need be added. If, however, any
doubt remain, the following quotation from a manuscript work of
Athanasius, a prelate of the Coptic church, who was Bishop of Kous,
will entirely remove it. “The Coptic language,” says he, “is divided
into three dialects; the Coptic dialect of Miser, the Bahiric, and
the Bashmuric: these different dialects are derived from the same
language.”

The introduction of Greek words into the Egyptian language commenced,
no doubt, from the time of the Macedonian conquest, which the
introduction of Christianity tended to confirm and extend. The
Christian religion contained so many new ideas, that new terms were
necessary to express them. These terms the language of Greece would
readily supply; which, probably, were adopted by the Egyptians, from
the Greek writings of the apostles.

Egyptian literature has recently attracted particular attention. All
that has come down to us of the language and literature of ancient
Egypt is contained in the Coptic, Sahidic, and Bashmuric dialects;
and in the Enchorial, Hieratic, and Hieroglyphic inscriptions and
manuscripts.

The Coptic, or, as it has been called, the Bahiric, but more properly
the Memphitic, was the dialect of Lower Egypt; the _Mizur_ of the
Scriptures. This dialect is more regular and systematic in its
grammatical construction, and more pure, than the others.

Manuscripts exist, in Coptic, of nearly the whole of the Sacred
Scriptures, and of the Services of the Coptic church. The works of
some of the early Fathers, and the Acts of the Council of Nice, and
also the Lives of a considerable number of Saints and Martyrs, are
found in the Coptic dialect.

Dr. Murray says, the Coptic is an original tongue, for it derives
all its indeclinable words and particles from radicals pertaining to
itself. Its verbs are derived from its own resources. There is no
mixture of any foreign language in its composition, except Greek.

The remains which we possess of the Egyptian language, when separated
from the Greek, with which it is in some measure mixed up, has no
near resemblance to any of the ancient or modern languages.

The importance of the Ancient Egyptian to the antiquary will at
once appear, when we consider that a knowledge of it is necessary
before the inscriptions on the monuments of Egypt can be properly
understood, and the Enchorial and Hieratic manuscripts can be fully
deciphered.

The terms Coptic and Sahidic have been adopted instead of Memphitic
and Thebaic, lest confusion should be created; as the former are used
in those Egyptian publications which have issued from the Oxford
University Press.

The Coptic alphabet contains Thirty-two Letters. It will be seen,
from a comparison of the alphabets, that the Egyptians adopted the
Greek alphabet, with the addition of seven letters.

The Gamma never occurs in Coptic words, except in one or two
instances. It is used instead of the Kappa in words derived from the
Greek.

The Xi is seldom found in Egyptian words, but principally occurs in
words derived from other languages. It is sometimes used instead of
_ks_.

The stops used, are one or two points, · : but two points are most
commonly used.

The mark used to divide the verses is +.

When the point or short line (`) occurs over consonants, it generally
expresses the vowel _e_ short.

It appears, from some words derived from the Greek, that the point
(`) has been used to express the vowels _a_ and _o_ short.

When the point (`) occurs above a vowel, it expresses the soft or
sharp breathing of the Greeks. When it is found above _e_ long, it
denotes the sharp accent; but when placed above the other vowels,
it either expresses the soft accent, or it denotes that the letter
should be pronounced separately, and agrees with the diæresis of the
Greeks.

When the point (`) is put over a vowel in the beginning of words
derived from the Greek, and which has the aspirate in that language,
it indicates a sharp breathing.

Some Coptic words are abbreviated by a line or lines above
them.--_Tattam’s Grammar of the Egyptian Language._ 8vo. 1830.

COPY.

The manuscript that is to be printed, or a book that is to be
reprinted; in short, any subject that is to be printed, is termed
_Copy_.

Where it is possible, copy should always be kept locked up in a
fire-proof closet. As it is rare for an author to have a duplicate,
the loss of the manuscript would in many instances be irretrievable;
it is also necessary to be very careful of the copy of new editions,
in which the author or editor has made alterations; of all posthumous
MS. works; and of unique copies, which sometimes are entrusted to the
printer, the loss or destruction of which would be an unpardonable
offence, unless it could be shown that all human precautions had been
taken for their preservation.

I cannot omit noticing the careless manner in which many compositors
keep their copy, leaving it loose on their frames and in their
windows, and frequently neglecting to shut them when they quit work
in summer, by which means the copy is sometimes blown away and lost,
and at other times portions of it are destroyed as waste paper. The
best method of preserving it is to have a paper case, or an old book
cover, to put it in, and to keep it in the well of the frame, or the
drawer when there is one.

Copy is generally given out to the compositor in regular portions:
if it be printed, a sheet at a time; if in manuscript, a chapter,
or section, as it may be; for the compositor has never the whole
volume in his hands at once, excepting it be bound, and not allowed
to be cut up, or taken to pieces. If the author supply it in small
quantities at a time, it is usually handed to the compositor as it is
received.

Many gentlemen who write for the press fall into an error, that
appears inconsistent even with common reasoning; viz. _that the
worse the manuscript is written, the more likely the work is to be
correctly printed_: for, say they, the more difficulty the printer
meets with in reading it, the more pains he is obliged to take
to understand the subject; and of course he will print it more
accurately than if he could pass it over in a slovenly manner.

In refutation of this prevalent error, I would ask those gentlemen,
if they have never received letters from their friends, so hastily
and carelessly written that their utmost efforts to decipher every
word have been baffled, although they might arrive at the general
meaning of the whole; I have myself seen letters which set at
defiance all attempts to read them: I would ask those gentlemen,
whether in examining ancient MSS. they have not often been perplexed
in making out the subject, and after all their endeavours have at
last risen from the task in many instances rather guessing at the
meaning than being certain of it. Even so, and worse, is the case of
the printer with ill-written manuscript, who frequently is ignorant
of the subject on which he is engaged; how then is it probable that
he should produce a proof as correct as if the manuscript were
written in a fair legible hand?--it is neither probable nor possible.
I have known more than one author, when appealed to for information
on his own writing, unable to read it, and of course unable to
explain to the workman the difficulty he was labouring under; and I
have heard one of these very persons, among others, maintain, that
the worse a manuscript was written, the more probability there was of
its being correctly printed.

  By the Act of the 39 G. 3. c. 79. s. 29. it is enacted, “That
  every Person who, from and after the Expiration of forty Days
  after the passing of this Act, shall print any Paper for Hire,
  Reward, Gain, or Profit, shall carefully preserve and keep one
  Copy (at least) of every Paper so printed by him or her, on which
  he or she shall write, or cause to be written or printed, in
  fair and legible Characters, the Name and Place of Abode of the
  Person or Persons by whom he or she shall be employed to print
  the same; and every Person printing any Paper for Hire, Reward,
  Gain, or Profit, who shall omit or neglect to write, or cause to
  be written or printed as aforesaid, the Name and Place of his
  or her Employer on one of such printed Papers, or to keep or
  preserve the same for the Space of six Calendar Months next after
  the Printing thereof, or to produce and shew the same to any
  Justice of the Peace, who, within the said Space of six Calendar
  Months, shall require to see the same, shall, for every such
  Omission, Neglect, or Refusal, forfeit and lose the Sum of twenty
  Pounds.”


COPY MONEY.

It appears from Moxon’s work, that in his time each compositor
received a copy of the work on which he was employed, or, in lieu of
it, a sum of money, which was called _Copy Money_. This custom is
abolished, and no remains of it exist. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS and TAKE
UP A SHEET.


COPYRIGHT. _See_ LITERARY PROPERTY.


CORDING QUIRES.

The outside quires of a ream of paper.--_M._ They are now called
Outsides, or Outside Quires. _See_ CASSIE PAPER.


CORNER IRONS.

Irons screwed on the coffin of a wooden press at the extremity of
each corner: these irons form a right angle at the outside, and an
obtuse angle on the inside, being thicker at the angle than at the
extreme ends, so as to allow the quoins to wedge up the form on the
press stone. They are quadrat high.


CORRECT.

When the corrector reads the proof, or the compositor mends the
faults he marked in the proof, they are both said to correct;
the corrector the proof, the compositor the form.--_M._ In the
first case, it is now styled reading the proof; in the next, the
compositor has to put right the errors and mistakes he has made in
the workmanship, previously to the sheet being sent to the author or
editor; this he does by picking out the wrong letters or words by
means of a sharp bodkin, and replacing them with the right ones; but
if he have left an out or made a double, he then takes the matter
into the composing stick, and over-runs it till he comes to the end
of a paragraph; or the error may make one or more even lines, when
the trouble is much lessened; still the length of the page must be
had in view and kept right, either by branching out where it will
admit of it, or by driving a line or two out, or getting a line or
two in in the adjoining pages, according to circumstances, but never
to make even lines too suddenly so as to cause the spacing to be
unsightly, by being too close, or too wide, for the sake of saving a
little trouble in over-running a few lines.

For the regularity and despatch of business a compositor should
never delay correcting after he has received the proof: it causes
disappointment to the author or proprietors of the work, and injures
his employer in his business, by obtaining for him the character
of want of regularity and punctuality; it injures the pressmen, by
delaying the forms going to press; and it ultimately injures himself,
by causing him to stand still for want of letter. It is a general
rule in printing offices, that a compositor should always impose as
soon as the sheet on which he is at work is out and made up, and that
he also should correct his proof without loss of time. _See_ AUTHOR’S
PROOF. FIRST PROOF.


CORRECTING

is the rectifying of such errors in the types as the compositor may
have made, and any defects in the workmanship; it also includes
making such alterations as the author, on examining the proof sheets,
may think necessary.

The German printers have an implement, made of wood, similar to
the back and bottom of a composing stick, in which they gather the
corrections, and place it with them in it on the form, without risk
of injuring the types, leaving their hands free from incumbrance.
This appears to be an improvement on our practice, which is, when
the corrections are numerous, to gather them in a composing stick,
and place it on the face of the form, for convenience of having them
close at hand; this should be avoided, and neither metal, nor any
other article that is likely to injure the types or an engraving,
should ever be laid on the face of the letter.

[Illustration: Composing stick for corrections]

The French and the Italians employ a pair of tweezers for picking
the wrong letters out of the form, by which they avoid injuring
the letter with the bodkin; but there is a bodkin attached to the
other end, to use when necessary. They say this is superior to our
method of taking out the wrong letter with a bodkin, and executed
more readily. In fact, with us there is frequent injury done by the
inexperienced or careless workman in using the bodkin: the letter is
often injured that is drawn out; if the bodkin is not very sharp,
it occasionally slips and spoils the face of six or seven adjoining
letters; and, by its injudicious use, the next letter, under the
blade of the bodkin, is often rendered useless.

[Illustration: A tool for removing a letter]

The specimen in p. 191. shows the manner of marking the corrections
in a proof. The following is an explanation of the marks therein
used, which will enable a gentleman who has to superintend a work
through the press to correct the proof sheets in a way that will
be clearly understood by the printer, and will tend to promote
correctness, by preventing those mistakes that occasionally occur
owing to his not comprehending all the marks on the proof.

Where a word is to be changed from small letters to capitals draw
three lines under it, and write _caps._ in the margin.

1. The substitution of a capital for a small letter.

2. The marks for turned commas, which designate extracts or
quotations.

3. The insertion of a hyphen.

4. The substitution of a small letter for a capital.

5. To change one word for another.

6. To take away a superfluous letter or word, the pen is struck
through it and a round topped _d_ made opposite, being the
contraction of the word _dele_, do thou expunge.

7. A letter turned upside down.

8. The insertion of a word or letter.

9. The substitution of a comma for another point, or for a letter put
in by mistake.

10. The substitution of a ; for another point.

11. When words are to be transposed, two ways of marking them are
shown; but they are not usually numbered, unless more than three
words have their order changed.

12. When a paragraph commences where it is not intended, connect the
matter by a line, and write in the margin opposite _run on_.

13. To draw the letters of a word close together that stand apart.

14. The marks for a new paragraph.

15. The substitution of a period or a colon for any other point. It
is customary to encircle these two points with a line.

16. Where a space or a quadrat stands up and appears, draw a line
under it, and make a strong perpendicular line in the margin.

17. Where there is a wrong letter, draw the pen through that letter,
and make the right one opposite in the margin.

18. The transposition of letters in a word.

19. The mark for a space where it has been omitted between two words.

20. The manner of marking an omission, or an insertion, when it is
too long to be written in the side margin. When this occurs it may be
done either at the top or the bottom of the page.

21. When one or more words have been struck out, and it is
subsequently decided that they should remain, make dots under them,
and write the word _stet_ in the margin.

22. When a letter of a different size from that used, or of a
different face, appears in a word, draw a line either through it or
under it, and write opposite _w. f._, for wrong fount.

23. Marks when the letters in a word do not stand even.

24. Marks when lines do not appear straight.

25. The mark for the insertion of an apostrophe.

Where a word has to be changed from Roman to Italic draw a line under
it, and write _Ital._ in the margin; and where a word has to be
changed from Italic to Roman, write _Rom._ opposite.

To change a word from small letters to small capitals, make two lines
under the word, and write _sm. caps._ opposite. To change a word from
small capitals to small letters make one line under the word, and
write in the margin _lo. ca._ for lower case.

Where the compositor has left an out, which is too long to be copied
in the margin of the proof, make a caret at the place, and write
opposite, _Out, see copy_.

The specimen when corrected would be as follows.

It is sublimely declared in the Christian Scriptures, that “God is
Love.” In truth, to figure to ourselves under any other character
a Being of infinite wisdom to conceive, and power to execute his
designs, would appal the imagination of his dependent creatures.
Neither can we find, in reasoning à priori, and from the nature of
things, any foundation for believing that the misery rather than the
happiness of those dependent creatures can be desired or devised by
a Being who cannot possibly be actuated by any of the motives from
which we know that injustice proceeds, as ignorance, selfishness, or
partiality; and who can have entertained, so far as we are able to
discover, no other object in creating man, except the intention of
finally communicating a larger proportion of happiness than misery.
These are the principles from which is deduced the necessity of
justice and benevolence in the Creator.

Arguments of this nature will have more or less effect, according
to the constitution of the mind to which they are presented. At the
same time it must be conceded, that the works of God, generally
considered, form the best criterion of his intentions; and that,
however indisputable the eternal truths may be which render goodness
inseparable from power and wisdom, there still remains a reasonable
inquiry, how far the actual appearance of the world justifies this
conclusion.

CORRECTING STONE.

The stone on which the compositor imposes and corrects his
forms.--_M._ It is now called _Imposing Stone_, which _see_.


CORRECTIONS.

The letters marked in a proof are called Corrections.--_M._ At the
present time, the right words or letters that are to replace the
wrong ones are understood by the word; thus a compositor, when he
collects the right letters for the purpose of correcting a form, is
said to _Gather the Corrections_.


CORRECTOR.

Moxon uses this word to designate the person whom we now call a
Reader. The word is not now used. _See_ READER.

COWPER, EDWARD. _See_ MACHINES.


CRAMPED.

In composing, when it is necessary to get in a given quantity of
matter into a certain number of pages, which are hardly sufficient
to contain it, whites are used sparingly, short pages are avoided,
and the matter is spaced closer than common; it is then said to be
cramped. A compositor is also said to cramp his matter when he does
not put whites proportionate to the openness of the work, or to the
size of the letter when there is no restriction.


CRAMP IRONS.

Short pieces of iron, polished on their face, fastened to the under
side of the plank, to run the carriage in and out upon the long ribs.
They are frequently called the Short Ribs. The two at each end are
turned again at the outer ends, to guide the carriage, and prevent
any lateral motion, and are called _Guide Cramps_. I have seen them
made of bell metal, as having less friction than iron running upon
iron.


CROSS.

Long Cross and Short Cross; two bars of iron crossing each other at
right angles and dovetailed into the rim of the chase, dividing it
into four quarters. The short cross is the broadest, and has a groove
for the points to fall in, for the purpose of making holes in the
sheet to work the reiteration in register.


CROTCHETS

or Brackets [ ] serve to enclose a word or sentence, which is to
be explained in a note, or the explanation itself, or a word or a
sentence which is intended to supply some deficiency, or to rectify
some mistake.--_Murray._


CUFIC. _See_ KOOFEE.


CULL PAPER.

To examine the cording quires, and select the best sheets out from
those that are so much damaged as to be unfit for use.--_M._


[Illustration: A tool for making the pelt balls more supple]

CURRYING IRON.

A square bar of iron, bent so as to make the middle
part of it project from the post or upright to which the ends are
fastened; the ends are flatted out, turned again at right angles,
with screw holes, and the middle of the projecting part is twisted.
Its use is to curry pelts.


CURRYING THE PELT.

Putting it half round the currying iron, or a post, and taking hold
of both ends, drawing it backwards and forwards to make it more
supple, and to take part of the moisture out. _See_ BALLS.


CURVILINEAR PRINTING.

In the year 1805, a Mr. Zach. Allnutt published proposals for “a New
Mode of Universal Linear Printing, named by me Curvilinear Printing,
being a neat, expeditious, and cheap Method of printing Plans of
Rivers, Canals, Roads, Estates, Encampments, Mathematical Figures,
and all other Sketches required to illustrate any Subject.”

“The Time required in executing such Plans, and on which a
Calculation of their Expence may be easily made, would be,

“For an Octavo Plan of Demy or Foolscap paper not very much crouded,
Time one person one day.

“For a Quarto Demy or Foolscap paper not much crouded, or for an
Octavo much crouded, Time two days.

“For a Folio Foolscap not much crouded, or Quarto much crouded, Time
three days.”

He then proceeds to say, that he had published a small pamphlet, in
which he had inserted some specimens of Maps of Rivers and Canals,
and a Plan of a Building; and executed various Plans of Estates; and
of Military Positions (but not with Soldier or Tent Types purposely
cast), and a Sketch of a Machine, &c.; and that these specimens
were composed with common printing types (except the Trees, Houses,
Churches, and Compass, which were cast so as to be moveable,) and
printed with a common letter-press.

He proposed to “discover and explain” “the precise Method of such
Curvilinear Printing, with a full and particular Description,” “if
a sufficient Number of Persons, to answer his Expectations, engage
as Subscribers of Ten Guineas each.” “But if there should not be a
sufficient Number of Subscribers hereto according to the Inventor’s
Expectations, He will be ready to treat with any Person, or Persons
collectively, for the sole Use of this New Method or Invention.”

I never knew of any person subscribing, or of any printer practising
this particular manner of printing; and I believe that Mr. Allnutt’s
discovery would have sunk into utter oblivion, but for a few of his
Proposals, one of which is now lying before me.


CUT-IN NOTES.

Side notes that are not arranged in the front margin down the side
of the page, but are inserted in the text, the lines of which are
shortened to admit the note, as if a piece of the text were cut out,
and the note inserted in the vacancy.


CUTTING THE FRISKET.

Cutting those parts of the paper away so as to allow the types to
print on its own paper, and to keep the margin clean.--_M._

_Remarks on the Alphabet._

Q, q, (Ku, pronounced _coo_) is here omitted, being not merely
superfluous and useless, but even prejudicial to a faithful
representation of the language, by observing the origin and affinity
of words, for instance, _Kvinde_, woman, is derived from _Kone_,
wife; _bekvem_, convenient, from _komme_, to come (Fr. venir);
_Kvartér_, a quarter of an hour, is also called _Kortér_; _Kvast_,
tuft, is originally the same word as _Kóst_, broom; and _kvæle_,
suffocate, the same as the English _kill_. The Q is therefore justly
rejected by the celebrated grammarian P. Syv, as also by the learned
Prof. S. N. J. Bloch in his _Danske Sproglære_, Odense 1817. It is
however still used by some, but always followed by _v_, never by _u_
in any Danish book, as, _Qvinde_, _beqvem_, _Qvarter_, &c.

Z, z, (Zet, pronounced _sett_) has crept from the German orthography
into a few words, which should be written by _s_, according to the
true pronunciation; as, _Zobel_, sable; _Zire_, to adorn; better
_Sobel_, _sire_.

Å has been, till the beginning of this century, commonly
represented by _aa_, according to the old Low German orthography,
but _å_ is found in ancient Danish and Norwegian manuscripts: its
reintroduction, proposed by the celebrated Danish grammarian Höjsgård
1743, later by Schlegel, Baden, Nyerup, Schrejber, Thonboe, &c.
has, in the last decennium, been realized in about thirty separate
books or pamphlets by Prof. A. Gamborg, Mr. H.J. Hansen, Mr. N.M.
Petersen, and also by E. Rask, and several anonymous writers. At all
events the sound is simple, and continually interchanging with other
simple vowels (_a_, _æ_, _o_,) in the inflection and derivation of
words, for instance, _tæller_, to count, in the past tense _talde_
or _tålde_, counted; _gå_, to go, _Gang_, gait, _gængse_, current,
common; from _Får_, sheep, is derived _Færøerne_, the Farroe islands.
Thus even in kindred dialects; as, _Vingård_, vineyard; _Tåre_,
tear, German Zähre; _Måned_, month, German Monath; _åben_, open, &c.
Whereas _aa_ is sometimes long _a_, sometimes even to be read in two
syllables as: _Haarlem_, _Aaron_, _Kanaan_, _Knud Danaast_, the name
of a Danish prince. The learner however will find _aa_ for _å_ in
most printed books hitherto published.

Æ, like Å, represents a simple vowel sound, and must never be
separated or resolved into _ae_, which make distinct syllables, for
instance, _bejae_ (be-ya-e), affirm.

Ø and Ö are commonly confounded, so that Ø is used for both sounds in
books printed in the Gothic type, Ö in those in the Roman character.

There are no diphthongs in Danish, but _aj_, _ej_, _oj_, _uj_,
_öj_, even though written by some _ai_, _ei_, _oi_, _ui_, _öi_, are
pronounced with the open sound of the vowels and a distinct _y_
consonant following, never like _ai_, _ei_, French _oi_, _ui_ or the
like, for instance, _ej_, not, sounds like English _eye_ or _I_;
_Konvoj_, a convoy, like the verb _to convoy_, &c.

In like manner _av_, _ev_, _iv_, _ov_, _æv_, _øv_ are pronounced as
clear vowels followed by a distinct _v_ consonant or rather _w_, for
the _v_ also is softer after the vowels than at the beginning, for
instance, _tav_, was silent; _Brev_, letter; _stiv_, stiff; _Tòv_,
cable; _Ræv_, fox; _døv_, deaf. The sound of _w_ is particularly
observable, when another consonant follows, for instance, _tavs_,
silent; _Evropa_, Europe; _stivne_, to stiffen; _hovne_, to swell;
_Hævn_, revenge; _søvnig_, sleepy, drowsy.

As to the division of words into syllables, _j_ is always referred to
the preceding vowel, which is in these cases constantly pronounced
short and sharp, for instance, _Vej-e_, ways, not _Ve-je_. The other
consonants are usually referred to the vowel following, when single;
or divided between the preceding and succeeding vowel, when more than
one, no care being taken to distinguish the radical parts from the
accessories, but in compound words, for instance, _Da-ge_, days, from
_Dag_, day, but _for-ud-si-ge_, foretell, from _for-ud_, beforehand,
and _sige_, tell, say.

It is a great advantage in the Danish orthography, that every noun
substantive is written with a capital letter at the beginning,
as numbers of words, else perfectly alike, are thereby easily
distinguished at the first view. Ex.

  (_en_) _Tale_, a speech,       (_at_) _tale_, to speak,
  (_en_) _Bör_, a bier,          (_jeg_) _bör_, I must, ought,
  (_en_) _Tro_, faith,           _tro_, faithful,
  (_en_) _Flöj_, weathercock,    _flöj_, flew,
  (_et_) _Önske_, a wish,        (_at_) _önske_, to wish,
  _Vande_, waters,               (_at_) _vande_, to water.

On the other hand, adjectives of national names are usually written
with small initials, contrary to the English usage, as, _dansk_,
Danish; _norsk_, Norwegian; _svensk_, Swedish; _hollandsk_, Dutch;
_engelsk_, English; _angelsaksisk_, Anglosaxon.

Though the Roman character is daily gaining ground, being introduced
into the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Copenhagen, and of most
other learned societies in Denmark and Norway, as also used in many
excellent works of private authors, yet the monkish or Gothic form of
the letters is still preferred by many.

In this character the capital ~J~ is also usually applied for the
~I~, for instance, ~Jsrael~ and ~Jesus~; the long ſ is constantly
applied in the beginning of syllables, even in the combinations: ſk,
ſl, ſp, ſt.

For å, has been proposed another figure, viz. [#], which has been
adopted by the celebrated Capt. Abrahamson in his first edition of
Langes _Dänische Gramm. für Deutsche_, as also by Rask, in the first
edition of his Icel. Grammar; that he has afterwards preferred the
å, is not only from patriotic motives; this figure being found in
old Danish MSS. down to 1555, but also because it is introduced into
several other languages, as Swedish and Laplandic, and has even been
used in the upper German dialects; also in the Bornholm dialect by
Mr. Skougaard, in the Farroic by the Revd. Mr. Lyngbye, and in the
Acra (on the coast of Guinea) by Capt. Schönning, whereas [#] is used
nowhere else in the world.--_From Rask’s Danish Grammar, Copenhagen_,
1830.


DASH. _See_ PUNCTUATION.


DELE,

Lat. The second person singular, imperative mood, of the active verb
_deleo_, to blot out, to expunge. This is a word that is much used in
a printing office; and its initial, with a round top, [#] or [#], is
the regular mark in proofs to expunge a letter, word, or words that
are redundant. _See_ CORRECTING.


DELIVERING BOOKS.

It is the general practice with publishers to leave a work when
finished, in the warehouse of the printer, and to send written orders
for the delivery of a part, as occasion or convenience suits; the
warehouseman should always be prepared to deliver copies to these
orders at the moment, otherwise complaint will be made against him,
and he will incur blame; but he ought not on any account to deliver
copies without a written order, for should there happen a mistake,
or an omission in the publishers making an entry, credit will not be
given for them, and he will become responsible. He ought invariably
to enter them instanter, and take the person’s signature to the
entry, and file the order. He will then be enabled, when an account
of the delivery is called for, to prove its correctness.


DEVIL.

The pressman sometimes has a week boy to take sheets, as they are
printed, off the tympan: these boys do in a printing house commonly
black and daub themselves; whence the workmen do jocosely call them
_Devils_; and sometimes _Spirits_, and sometimes _Flies_.--_M._ The
boys that make the fires, sweep the rooms, assist in the warehouse,
and go on errands, are now called _Devils_, or _Printers Devils_; but
in the trade they are generally styled _Errand Boys_ and _Warehouse
Boys_. _See_ FLY.

DIAMOND.

The name of a type one size smaller than Pearl, and the smallest that
is cast in the British founderies. It originated in casting a type
with a pearl face upon a smaller body, for the purpose of getting
in, in printing pocket Bibles; the founders subsequently cut it with
a smaller face, and made it completely a distinct size. It is not
enumerated in Moxon’s list. _See_ TYPES.

page.--_M._ It is the first word of the following page. _See_ CATCH

_TO_ DISTRIBUTE.

To replace the types in their respective boxes in the cases after
printing therewith, in order to their being used again. This is
done in a very expeditious manner by the compositor, who, placing
his composing rule against the head of a page, with his thumbs
against it, pressing the sides of both his third fingers against the
sides of the matter, and his forefingers against the bottom line
of the quantity which he means to lift, takes up what is termed a
handful, and keeping the face of the letter towards him, rests one
end of the composing rule against the ball of the thumb of his left
hand, and pressing the other end of the rule with the third finger,
steadies the matter with his forefinger, and thus has his right hand
at liberty, with which he takes a word or part of a word from the
uppermost line as he holds it in his hand, and drops the several
letters into their particular boxes. Matter is always wetted when
distributed, to render it slightly cohesive, as the operation is thus
performed with more facility than when dry. When the form has not
been well rinsed in laying-up, and the types have been much used,
the ends of the fingers are apt to get smooth, so as to lose the
command, in some measure, of dropping the types into their places
with quickness and certainty; in this case compositors frequently
keep a piece of alum in some part of the case, and occasionally
touch it with their thumb and two fingers, which gives them a little
roughness, and restores their command of the types.

If a compositor is desirous of producing his first proofs free from
literal errors, he should be particular in distributing clean, that
is, depositing each letter in its proper box.

When new letter remains in chase, locked up for any considerable
time, it becomes what is termed, baked. _See_ BAKE.

DIVIDING.

There are practical rules in printing for dividing words where the
whole of a word cannot be comprised within the line; and there are
also grammatical rules for the same object. Every printing office has
some peculiarity on this subject.

The most general practical method of dividing words is to preserve
the primitive word at the end of a line, and carry the termination to
the next line; but this cannot always be done, as the following few
instances will show. In these and similar cases it will be better to
avoid dividing the word, and either drive the whole out, or get the
termination in, as the spacing of the line will best allow.

  air-y             bulge-d           change-d          chuff-y
  brace-d           carve-d           charge-d          cleave-r
  brawn-y           cause-d           chose-n           cloud-y
  craft-y           gloom-y           might-y           scrape-r
  crust-y           judge-d           nest-le           strange-r
  curve-d           lapse-d           part-y            tame-d
  date-d            large-st          plate-d           tease-d
  dew-y             love-r            rate-d            tune-r
  earth-y           luck-y            rhime-r           vote-r
  give-n            make-r            safe-r            write-r

Words whose plurals are formed by the addition of s, which adds
another syllable to them, by making the last into two, ought not to
have these two syllables divided; such as--

  accom-plices      conse-quences     frontis-pieces    prefer-ences
  acquaint-ances    differ-ences      hinder-ances      privi-leges
  advan-tages       discord-ances     observ-ances      quintes-sences
  allow-ances       disturb-ances     occur-rences      recom-pences
  appear-ances      embas-sages       over-charges      redun-dances
  arti-fices        enter-prises      perform-ances     reli-ances
  bene-fices        equi-pages        petu-lances       resem-blances
  cogni-zances      evi-dences        post-offices      resi-dences
  conni-vances      exer-cises        preci-pices       sen-tences.

The terminations of words, chion, cial, cient, cion, cious, shion,
sian, sion, tial, tion, and tious, ought never, in my opinion, to be
divided, as they each form one sound, although Murray and Walker say
they form two syllables.

When the primitive word cannot be retained at the end of a line, I
would prefer the prefixes ab, ac, ad, al, anti, be, bi, co, com, con,
de, di, dia, dis, en, in, per, pre, pro, re, sub, super, un, when
words in which they occur require to be divided; provided it does not
cause any great violence in the spacing.

When it is necessary to divide a word at the end of a line, it is
also necessary to study the appearance of the termination of that
line, as well as of the commencement of the succeeding line, for they
are equally affected. An improper division of a word will sometimes
look better than a proper one, but it ought always to be avoided, if
possible.

It frequently happens that the last syllable, when it is short, has
a meagre appearance at the beginning of a line; when this is the
case, it is preferable to drive out another syllable, provided the
appearance and the correctness of the first part of the word are not
compromised.

It is not usual, and is looked on as bad workmanship, to divide a
word with a single letter at the end of a line, for it may be driven
out, or, if the line be wide spaced, the next syllable may be got in;
but should the second syllable of the word be a long one, or the last
syllable a very short one, it will then be advisable to overrun a
preceding line or two, to get rid of the objectionable division.

Neither is it usual to carry over the last syllable of a word if it
consist of two thin letters only; for the hyphen is more than equal
to one of them, and changing two or three spaces will make room for
the other, without affecting the appearance.

Some persons object to the dividing of words at all in printing, as
being unnecessary and displeasing to the eye; but then they must
sacrifice all regularity of spacing, which is still worse, and
has the appearance of bad workmanship. I would recommend that a
compositor should make each give way a little to the other, always
preserving such an uniformity in spacing that there should be no
glaring disproportion in different lines.

Avoid dividing words in lines following each other, so as not to have
hyphens at the ends of two adjoining lines, but never have three or
more divided words at the ends of consecutive lines; although five
or six may occasionally be seen, yet in book work it is held to be
bad workmanship, and should never be allowed to pass. Neither is it
desirable to divide proper names, nor the last word in a page so as
to have part of a word to begin the succeeding page, particularly
when it is an even one; sums of money and series of figures are never
divided.

It is not possible in every instance to divide words correctly,
particularly when the page is of a narrow measure, and the type
large; when this happens, the compositor is obliged frequently to
sacrifice correctness to necessity; but when the page is of a width
proportionate to the size of the type, he may in the usual way of
workmanship preserve his regular spacing, and also his correct
dividing.

The preceding observations may be looked on as practical ones for
printing. Lindley Murray gives the following grammatical directions
for dividing words.

“1. A single consonant between two vowels must be joined to the
latter syllable: as, de-light, bri-dal, re-source: except the letter
x; as, ex-ist, ex-amine: and except likewise words compounded; as,
up-on, un-even, dis-ease.

“2. Two consonants proper to begin a word, must not be separated; as,
fa-ble, sti-fle. But when they come between two vowels, and are such
as cannot begin a word, they must be divided; as, ut-most, un-der,
in-sect, er-ror, cof-fin.

“If the preceding syllable is short, the consonants must be
separated: as, cus-tard, pub-lic, gos-ling.

“3. When three consonants meet in the middle of a word, if they can
begin a word, and the preceding vowel be pronounced long, they are
not to be separated; as, de-throne, de-stroy. But when the vowel of
the preceding syllable is pronounced short, one of the consonants
always belongs to that syllable; as, dis-tract, dis-prove, dis-train.

“4. When three or four consonants, which are not proper to begin a
word, meet between two vowels, the first consonant is always kept
with the first syllable in the division: as, ab-stain, com-plete,
em-broil, dan-dler, dap-ple, con-strain.

“5. Two vowels, not being a diphthong, must be divided into separate
syllables; as, cru-el, deni-al, soci-ety.

“A diphthong immediately preceding a vowel, is to be separated from
it: as, roy-al, pow-er, jew-el.

“6. Compounded words must be traced into the simple words of
which they are composed; as, ice-house, glow-worm, over-power,
never-the-less.

“7. Grammatical, and other particular terminations, are generally
separated: as, teach-est, teach-eth, teach-ing, teach-er,
contend-est, great-er, wretch-ed, good-ness, free-dom, false-hood.

“Two consonants which form but one sound, are never separated: as,
e-cho, fa-ther, pro-phet, an-chor, bi-shop. They are to be considered
as a single letter.

“8. In derivative words, the additional syllables are separated:
as, sweet-er, sweet-est, sweet-ly; learn-ed, learn-eth, learn-ing;
dis-like, mis-lead, un-even; call-ed, roll-er, dress-ing; gold-en,
bolt-ed, believ-er, pleas-ing.

“_Exceptions._ When the derivative word doubles the single letter of
the primitive, one of those letters is joined to the termination: as,
beg, beg-gar; fat, fat-ter; bid, bid-ding.

“When the additional syllable is preceded by _c_ or _g_ soft, the
_c_ or _g_ is added to that syllable: as, of-fen-ces, cotta-ges,
pro-noun-cer, in-dul-ging; ra-cer, fa-cing, spi-ced; wa-ger, ra-ging,
pla-ced, ran-ger, chan-ging, chan-ged.

“When the preceding single vowel is long, the consonant, if single,
is joined to the termination: as, ba-ker, ba-king; ho-ping, bro-ken;
po-ker, bo-ny; wri-ter, sla-vish; mu-sed, sa-ved.

“The termination _y_ is not to be placed alone: as, san-dy,
gras-sy; dir-ty, dus-ty; mos-sy, fros-ty; hea-dy, woo-dy; except,
dough-y, snow-y, string-y, and a few other words. But even in these
exceptions, it would be proper to avoid beginning a line with the
termination _y_.

“Some of the preceding rules may be liable to considerable
exceptions; and therefore it is said by Dr. Lowth and others,
that the best and easiest directions for dividing the syllables
in spelling, is to divide them as they are naturally separated in
a right pronunciation, without regard to the derivation of words,
or the possible combination of consonants at the beginning of a
syllable.”

Before quitting this subject, it should be stated that there is yet
a mode of dividing, which is peculiar to the philologist. To him it
appears but natural that a compounded word should be divided at the
point where its elements were originally conjoined. With respect to
a purely English compound we find this to be one of Murray’s rules;
but in an adopted word, however much from its recurrence it may
seem to have become our own, the scholar’s eye is offended, if,
where a division has become requisite, it be made in violation of
etymological principles. This remark must be understood as having
reference only to the division which would occur in the neighbourhood
of the point of junction: in other respects he does not impugn the
validity of the rules which are in general laid down. To apply with
precision this principle, which, when judiciously practised, is
frequently very highly approved, it is evident that an acquaintance
with the language from which the imported word has been derived, is
necessary: yet, as a person not thus qualified may occasionally be
required to make his divisions in conformity with this system, it
has been thought desirable to subjoin a brief list of words in which
an uninitiated person would be most likely to err. A few of the
following divisions will appear a little startling, and they are in
consequence generally evaded; but it has been thought proper in this
place to conceal nothing from the general eye which may appear to
militate against the full adoption of the system. The words selected
are but a few of the very large class of compounds; but the rest have
been omitted, as their analytical and their syllabical divisions will
in general be found to coincide.

  * This word has had the singular fortune of having been all but
  universally mis-spelt; having in its present form the appearance
  of being what is inadmissible--the compound of a Latin and
  an English word. A few years ago an ingenious critic, in a
  work which he published, corrected this spelling by writing
  the word “frontispice.” As the word comes immediately from
  _frontispicium_, the emendation appears to have been judiciously
  made. (Compare _auspice_, from _auspicium_ = avispicium.) It may
  not be unnecessary also to observe, that the amended form is that
  in which it appears in the French language. The division of the
  corrected word would be fronti-spice.

The register of the lands of England, framed by order of William the
Conqueror. It was sometimes termed _Rotulus Wintoniæ_, and was the
book from which judgment was to be given upon the value, tenures, and
services of the lands therein described.

In 1767, in consequence of an address of the House of Lords, His
Majesty George III. gave directions for the publication of this
Survey. It was not, however, till after 1770 that the work was
actually commenced. Its publication was entrusted to Mr. Abraham
Farley, a gentleman of learning as well as of great experience in
records, who had almost daily recourse to the book for more than
forty years. It was completed early in 1783, having been ten years
in passing through the press, and thus became generally accessible
to the antiquary and topographer. It was printed in facsimile, as
far as regular types, assisted by the representation of original
contractions, could imitate the original.

DONATIONS.

Abstract of the Charitable Donations at the Disposal of the Court of
Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Stationers. I have selected
those Donations only which relate, directly or indirectly, to
Printers.

  William Norton, a printer of great note, lived in St. Paul’s
  Churchyard, who died in 1593. He gave six pounds thirteen
  shillings and four pence, yearly to his company, to be lent
  to young men, free of the same Company. The Company in their
  Abstract of Charitable Donations say “to the Poor of the said
  Company.”

  Mr. Christopher Meredith, in 1655, gave 10_l._ a year, to be paid
  in quarterly pensions to the poor of the Company.

  Thomas Guy, Esq., M.P., an eminent bookseller, and the munificent
  founder of the hospital which bears his name, gave to the
  Company, in 1717, 1,000_l._ “to enable them to add 50_l._ a
  year, by quarterly payments, to the poor members and widows, in
  augmentation of the quarterly charity.”

  Mr. Theophilus Cater, in 1718, gave 1,000_l._ to the Company, on
  condition of their paying him an annuity of 50_l._ for his own
  life.--After his death, 40_l._ to be thus disposed of: to the
  minister of St. Martin’s, Ludgate, for a sermon, 1_l._ 10_s._;
  to the reader, 5_s._; to the clerk and sexton, 2_s._ 6_d._
  each, 5_s._; to fourteen poor freemen of the Company, 14_l._;
  to ten poor men of St. Martin’s, 10_l._; to ten poor men of
  Christchurch, 1_l._ each. The remainder, (being 4_l._) towards a
  dinner for the master, wardens, and assistants.

  Mrs. Beata Wilkins, in 1773, gave the picture of Doctor
  Hoadly, lord bishop of Winchester, now in the Stock-room;
  and the interest and produce of all the money arising from
  her forty-pounds share stock (computed at 320_l._) to be
  distributed, annually, amongst six poor men and six poor widows,
  not pensioners to the Company, in the month of December, before
  Christmas.--_Note._ The produce of the share was laid out in the
  purchase of 358_l._ 11_s._ 4_d._ five per cent. Navy annuities.
  The yearly dividend is 17_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._ To which the Court add
  1_s._ 6_d._ to make the dividend to each annuitant 1_l._ 10_s._

  William Bowyer. _See_ BOWYER.

  William Strahan, Esq., M. P., in 1784, gave 1,000_l._, one
  half of the annual interest to be divided in equal shares or
  proportions to five poor journeymen printers, natives of England
  or Wales, freemen of the Company; the other half in equal
  shares or proportions to five poor journeymen printers, natives
  of Scotland, without regard to their being freemen or being
  non-freemen of the Company.--_Note._ The yearly dividend of this
  bequest is 39_l._ 14_s._ 10_d._--to which _5s._ 2_d._ (part of
  a subsequent donation by Andrew Strahan, Esq.) has since been
  added, to make the dividend to each annuitant 4_l._

  Thomas Wright, Esq., late alderman of London, in 1794, gave
  2,000_l._ four per cent. Bank annuities, the dividends to be
  distributed as follows; upon the first day of January 50_l._
  8_s._ amongst twenty-four poor freemen of the said Company, not
  receiving any other pension from the Company, 2_l._ 2_s._ each.
  To the clerk of the Company 3_l._ 3_s._ for his trouble upon
  this occasion. And 26_l._ 9_s._ residue of such dividends, for
  providing a dinner for the master, wardens, and assistants, of
  the Company, upon the day of distribution.

  Mr. Richard Johnson, in 1795, gave all the remainder of his
  property whatsoever, to the Company, upon the following
  conditions: that they allow his sister, Mary Johnson, 50_l._ per
  annum, and 10_l._ per annum to his uncle Lockington Johnson,
  or to his wife, Elizabeth Johnson, during their natural lives.
  After the deaths of his sister and uncle, and his wife, the whole
  property to be divided half-yearly, “among five very poor widows,
  who have seen better days, above the age of sixty, whose husbands
  were liverymen, and in a good way of business; were either
  stationers, printers, booksellers, or binders.”

  Charles Dilly, Esq., in November, 1803, (being then a member of
  the Court of Assistants,) transferred 700_l._ three per cent.
  annuities to the Company, the dividends to be “paid equally to
  two widows of liverymen of the Company, who have lived in better
  circumstances, and met unexpected misfortunes, but who, through
  their conduct and manners in life, are deserving of superior
  help. And if there should be candidates of sixty years of age, or
  upwards, I should wish them to have the preference.”

  Mrs. Elizabeth Baldwin, widow of Mr. Richard Baldwin a liveryman,
  gave 250_l._ stock in the three per cents, the dividends to
  be laid out and expended in the purchase of five great coats,
  to be annually given to five poor liverymen or freemen of the
  said Company in the first week of the month of December for
  ever.--_Note._ Mrs. Baldwin died 19th August, 1809.

  Andrew Strahan, Esq., M. P., (first benefaction,) in January
  1815, transferred 1,225_l._ four per cent. annuities to the
  Company, the interest, viz. 49_l._, to be applied as follows,
  viz.,

  “Eight pounds per annum to each of the six pensioners amongst my
  father’s annuitants who shall have been earliest elected into
  that list, in lieu of the 4_l._ which they at present enjoy. And
  whenever any of the pensions of 8_l._ each shall become vacant,
  the pensioner who shall stand first on the list of my father’s
  annuitants of 4_l._ to succeed to such vacancy, without troubling
  the court to make a new election, except for the vacancy
  occasioned thereby in the annuitants of 4_l._ And as 5_s._ 2_d._
  is added by the court to make up the pensions of my late father
  4_l._ to each annuitant, I would have the sum of 5_s._ 2_d._
  (part of the surplus of 1_l._) applied to that purpose. The
  remaining 14_s._ 10_d._ I would have given to the beadle of the
  Company, who has some trouble in receiving the petitions.

  “The pensions above given it is my wish should be paid twice in
  the year; the one half at the same period as the pensions given
  by my late father, and the other half at midsummer.

  “I observe that my father’s pensioners are to be elected
  annually, which, I believe, may not always have been strictly
  complied with; but, by being so bequeathed, it enables the court
  to displace any individual who may at any time after his being
  elected appear to the court not to be deserving; and it is my
  wish that the court should have the same power of displacing
  any of the pensioners of eight pounds who shall appear to them
  undeserving.”

  John Nichols, Esq., transferred to the Company, in June, 1817,
  500_l._ four per cent. annuities, “as an addition of a small
  supplement to the works of my late friend and partner, Mr.
  William Bowyer,” [_See_ BOWYER.] “to pay the dividends to the
  persons mentioned in the following list; one of whom has worked
  for me more than fifty years, another much more than forty, and
  the others nearly thirty years.

  “15_l._ a year to Thomas Bennett, in addition to the annuity he
  now enjoys.

  “5_l._ a year to William Morlis, in addition to what he now
  enjoys, or may hereafter enjoy.

  “On the death of Bennett, his 15_l._ to be divided into three
  annuities, for James Rousseau, John Meeson, and James Robinson,
  if then living, otherwise to any other compositor or pressman of
  good character, not less than forty-five years of age, and who
  shall have been at least twenty-one years free of the Stationers’
  Company.

  “On the death of Morlis his five pounds to be added to the person
  who then stands first on the list; so that eventually there will
  only be one annuitant of ten pounds, and two of five pounds each.

  “The annuitants to be paid at the same times as those of Mr.
  Bowyer.” J. N.

  Andrew Strahan, Esq., M. P., (second benefaction,) transferred
  in March, 1818, the further sum of 1,000_l._ four per cent.
  annuities, “to pay the dividends half-yearly in portions of
  ten pounds to four distressed old printers. No person to be
  eligible till he be sixty-five years of age: he may be freeman or
  non-freeman, compositor or pressman, or have been for many years
  employed regularly as corrector or reader in a printing-office
  within the Bills of Mortality, and not necessarily one of my late
  father’s annuitants or of mine.”

  Luke Hansard, Esq., (first benefaction,) on the 11th of July,
  1818, transferred to the Company 1,000_l._ four per cent.
  annuities, the interest to be given, in two annuities of 10_l._ a
  year each, to such objects above sixty-five years of age, free of
  the Company, and letterpress printers, (compositors or pressmen,)
  as the court shall judge proper.

  The other 20_l._ to be given yearly to four freemen of this
  Company, printers, booksellers, stationers, warehousemen, or
  bookbinders, above sixty years of age, at 5_l._ a year each, as
  the court shall think proper objects of this donation.

  Luke Hansard, Esq., (second benefaction,) in September, 1818,
  transferred to the Company 1,500_l._ three per cent. annuities;
  in trust to give to every youth bound at their hall, a neatly
  bound Church of England Prayer-book, as printed by his majesty’s
  printer in London, bound up with the New Version of Psalms.

  The number of Prayer-books thus to be disposed of, are taken at
  200, which at a presumed price of 2_s._ 7_d._ each, will cost
  yearly 25_l._ 16_s._ 8_d._

  Then to give yearly to two of his warehousemen (named) 6_l._
  6_s._ each.

  Also to “such warehouseman, or binder, or stationer, or other
  person in the class to whom the court has been accustomed to give
  such annuities, above sixty years of age,” 6_l._ 6_s._

  The residue of 5_s._ 4_d._, and whatever residue may be left from
  the 200 Prayer-books not being wanted, or from the cost being
  less, to be applicable for such purposes as the court shall think
  proper.

  Beale Blackwell, Esq., gave, July, 1817, so much Bank stock as at
  the time of his death would produce the annual sum of 100_l._,
  to be every year distributed equally amongst twenty deserving
  journeymen letterpress printers; the first distribution of which
  took place in October, 1821.

  A more detailed account of these charitable donations and
  benefactions will be found in a pamphlet of 32 pages, printed by
  order of the court in 1819, and given to each liveryman.

  This account is copied from Hansard’s Typographia.


DOTTED QUADRATS,

or dotted leaders. Quadrats with dots on them, similar to full
points, at regular distances. They are cast from an en, with one
point, to four ems.

In tables of contents, indices, and other similar matter, dotted
quadrats are preferred to metal rules, or hyphens, being thought to
have a neater appearance.


DOUBLE.

A sheet that is twice pulled and lifted never so little off the form
after it was first pulled, does most commonly (through the play of
the joints of the tympan) take a double impression: this sheet is
said to double. Or if the pressman run in so, as the foreside of the
platen print with the first pull into part of the second pull, or
the hind edge of the platen print with his second pull into part of
his first pull; either of these twice printing is called _Doubling_.
Doubling also happens through the loose hanging of the platen, and
through too much play the tenons of the head may have in the mortises
of the cheeks; and indeed through many wearings and crazinesses that
often happen in several parts of the press.--_M._ Moxon’s account of
doubling and its causes refer to the two pull wooden presses, but
some of them apply equally to iron presses.

In composing, the term is applied when a word, a line, a sentence, or
any part of the copy is composed twice; that is, if the compositor’s
eye catch a part that he has already composed, and he repeats it.


DOUBLE DAGGER.

This is the technical name of a mark used as a reference, ‡; it is
generally placed the third in order,--after the obelisk or dagger.


DOUBLE LETTERS.

Æ, œ, ſt, ſh, and several others cast on one shank, are called double
letters: ſ and f have several ascending letters joined to them,
because their beaks hanging over their stems would (were they not
cast on one shank) ride upon the tops of the stems of the adjoining
ascending letters.--_M._

By discarding the ſ, we have lessened the number of our double
letters, which are now reduced to the diphthongs æ and œ, and to ﬀ,
ﬁ, ﬂ, ﬃ, and ﬄ, which are so termed by printers.


DOUBLE NARROW.

A piece of furniture equal in breadth to two narrow quotations. There
are different sizes used in making margin, and in imposing, viz.,
double broad, double broad and narrow, broad and narrow, broad and
double narrow.


DOUBLE PICA.

The name of a type, one size larger than Paragon, and one smaller
than Two-Line Pica. It is equal in depth to two Small Pica bodies.
_See_ TYPES.


DRAW.

When a form is working at press, and any of the letters are loosely
justified, or from any other cause are not tight in the form, and the
adhesion of the ink and balls or rollers pulls them out, they are
said to draw. This accident too frequently occurs; and as it is not
always perceived, errors arise which neither the care nor the skill
of the reader can prevent; when it is perceived, after an impression
or two have been pulled, the pressmen often put the letters into the
wrong place, and thus cause an error. They are occasionally left
by the ball on the form, and produce a batter, which is a waste of
materials, and of time in repairing it. A good compositor guards
against this evil by care in justifying his lines, and also in
locking up.


DRAWN SHEETS.

In collating books in the warehouse, after they have been gathered,
duplicate sheets, and sheets of wrong signatures, are occasionally
found; arising, in the one instance, from the carelessness of
the gathering boys, in taking up more than one sheet of the same
signature; and, in the other, from a lift of another sheet being
occasionally taken down and mixed in the heap: in these cases the
sheets are drawn out of the book, and laid on one side, and, after
some accumulation, are replaced upon their respective heaps, to be
gathered again right. These sheets are called _Drawn Sheets_.


DRESS A CHASE,

or, Dress a Form, is to fit the pages and the chase with furniture
and quoins. _See_ MARGIN.


DRESSING BLOCK.

Made of pear tree, because a soft wood, and therefore less subject
to injure the face of the letter; it is commonly about three inches
square, and an inch high.--_M._ Used the same as our planer. _See_
PLANER.


DRIPPING PAN.

Literally so, made of tinned iron, extending the whole length of the
press, fixed under the long ribs, to preserve the floor from the
droppings of oil.

They are useful articles; for presses to be kept in good working
order require to be frequently oiled; and for want of a dripping pan,
I have known the oil run through the joints of the floor upon a pile
of paper in a room underneath, and spoil a considerable quantity.


DRIVE OUT.

When a compositor sets wide, he is said to drive out or run out.
In founding, if letter be cast too thick in the shank, it drives
out.--_M._ If copy make more than was calculated on, they say, it
drives out; if less, and it is intended that it shall make the
precise quantity decided on, they say, you must drive out; that is,
it must be branched out in proportion, and not cramped.


DROPPING OUT.

After a form is locked up, and, when it is being lifted from the
stone, or being laid upon the imposing stone, or the press, any
letters, spaces, or quadrats fall out, it is said something drops
out, or something has dropped out; this may arise from some of the
lines being badly justified--some of the leads riding--or some of the
furniture binding--or similar causes--and frequently produces errors

In this case, before the form is put to press, it should be examined
to ascertain the cause, and any impediment to its safety should be
removed.

DUCK’S BILL.

A tongue cut in a piece of stout paper, which is pasted on the tympan
at the bottom of the tympan sheet, to support the white paper when
working, instead of pins; the paper to be printed rests in the slit
behind the tongue, and takes a good bearing.

[Illustration: A tool to support paper in the press]

It is seldom used except in the best work, where the paper printed is
fine, stout, large, and expensive, when extra precautions are taken
to prevent waste.


DUODECIMO.

The size of a book, generally for shortness written 12mo, and hence
frequently incorrectly so pronounced. It is formed by folding a sheet
of paper into twelve portions or leaves, making twenty-four pages.
_See_ IMPOSING.




E.


EAR OF THE FRISKET.

A projecting piece of iron on the near side of the frisket, by taking
hold of which the pressman turns down the frisket, and at the same
time the tympan; and as it projects a little beyond the tympan, he
also raises the sheet off the form by grasping it and the tympan, and
by a quick motion quits hold of the tympan, and turns up the frisket
by means of the ear. It is sometimes called the _Thumb Piece_.


EASY PULL.

When the form feels the force of the spindle by degrees, till the bar
comes almost to the hither cheek of the press, it is called a _Long_,
or a _Soaking_, or _Easy Pull_, and is also called a _Soft Pull_;
because it comes soft and soakingly and easily down.--_M._


EASY WORK.

With compositors, printed copy, or a fair written hand, and full of
breaks, pleases well, and is called good copy, light, easy work: with
pressmen, great letter and a small form is called easy work.--_M._

The term is not now generally used: what Moxon describes as relating
to compositors would now be termed good copy; and with respect to
pressmen it would be called light work, or a light form.

ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD.

As the method of printing engravings on wood, here described, applies
to what is termed fine printing, it may be as well in the outset to
define what is meant by this expression, in its application to this
subject.

Fine printing, in this point of view, is the art of obtaining
impressions from an engraving on wood, of the surface and the surface
only, so as to produce the effect which the artist intended, in the
highest state of perfection.

There is a material difference between an engraving on wood and one
on copper: the first is engraved in relief, that is, the lines are
left standing, and the part which in the impression is to appear
white is cut away or, technically, blocked out; the lines of the
engraving on copper, on the contrary, are cut in the metal, and the
part that is to be white in the impression is left untouched in the
metal by the engraver.

There is also a material difference in the manner of obtaining
impressions: those from an engraving on wood are produced by coating
the surface of the lines with ink by beating it with balls or passing
a roller over it, and then, with a piece of paper upon it, submitting
it to pressure between two parallel plane surfaces, or by a cylinder
rolling over it. An engraving on copper is smeared over the whole
face with ink, which is worked into the lines; the surplus ink is
then wiped off the surface of the plate, on which a piece of paper
is laid to receive the impression, and these are passed between two
cylinders, which press the paper into the engraved lines by a violent
squeeze.

It will easily be perceived by this slight description that the two
processes are completely distinct from each other, although the
effect produced is nearly the same.

I will now proceed to describe the process of producing impressions
from engravings on wood in a superior manner.

After putting a block on the press, the workman ought to be
very gentle in the pull for the first impression, to prevent an
accident, which has frequently occurred from thoughtlessness in
this particular, by making the pull too hard, and crushing some of
the lines; by avoiding this he will be safe, and can proportion his
pull to the subject. He should also examine, previous to pulling,
that there be nothing on the block--no pins that he may have for his
tympan sheet, nor any needle with which he may have been taking out
a pick.--Such accidents have happened, and caused great trouble to
the engraver, as well as loss of time and disappointment; besides
entailing a character of carelessness on the printer.

In imposing a single block, where the press is large at which it is
to be worked, it will be in danger of springing out of the chase
while beating, from the quantity of furniture about it: it is a good
remedy to impose it in a job chase, and to impose this chase again
in a larger one; this will cause it to lie flatter on the press, and
firmer in the beating, as the small chase can be locked up tight in
the large one, without having too much furniture, and the large one
can be secured firmly on the press by quoins and the corner irons.

Neither the pressure nor the impression in an engraving on wood
should be uniformly equal: if they be, the effect that is intended
to be produced by the artist will fail; and instead of light, middle
tint, and shade, an impression will be produced that possesses none
of them in perfection; some parts will be too hard and black, and
other parts have neither pressure nor colour enough, with obscurity
and roughness, and without any of the mildness of the middle tint,
which ought to pervade great part of an engraving, and on which the
eye reposes after viewing the strong lights and the deep shades.

To produce the desired effect, great nicety and patience are
required in the pressman; a single thickness of thin India paper,
which is the paper I would always recommend to be used as overlays
for engravings, is frequently required over very small parts, with
the edges of it scraped down, for it is advisable that the overlay
should never be cut at the edges, but, even where great delicacy of
shape is not required, that it should be torn into the form wanted,
which reduces the thickness of the edges, and causes the additional
pressure to blend with the surrounding parts.

Particular parts of the impression will frequently come up much
too strong, and other parts too weak, it will then be necessary to
take out from between the tympans a thickness of paper, and add an
additional tympan sheet, cutting away those parts that come off too
hard, and scraping down the edges; scraping away half the thickness
of a tympan sheet in small parts that require to be a little
lightened will improve the impression.

The light parts require little pressure, but the depths should be
brought up so as to produce a full and firm impression.

If a block be hollow on the surface, underlaying the hollow part will
bring it up better than overlaying it, at least so much that it shall
only require a thickness or two of paper as overlays. If a block be
too low, it is advisable to underlay it, for the purpose of raising
it to the proper height, in preference to making use of overlays,
for they act in some measure as blankets, being pressed into the
interstices, and rendering the lines thicker than in the engraving.

It will be necessary sometimes, when the surface of the block is very
uneven, to tear away parts of the paper in the tympan, to equalise
the impression where it is too hard.

The pressman will find it convenient to pull a few impressions
while he is making ready, on soiled or damaged India paper, for out
of these he can cut overlays to the precise shape and size that
is wanted, as he will constantly find it necessary to do so in
instances where great accuracy is required in overlaying particular
portions; and in these instances he cannot well do without a sharp
penknife and a pair of good small scissars. A fine sharp bodkin and
a needle or two, to take out picks, are also needful; but he should
be particularly careful in so using them as that he do no injury.
The best way to avoid this is to draw the bodkin or needle point
cautiously in the direction of the lines.

Engravings that are in the vignette form require great attention to
keep the edges light and clear, and in general it is necessary to
scrape away one or two thicknesses of paper, in order to lighten
the impression and keep it clean; for the edges being irregular,
and parts, such as small branches of trees, leaves, &c. straggling,
for the purpose of giving freedom to the design, they are subject
to come off too hard, and are liable to picks, which give great
trouble, and are difficult to be kept clear of. Bearers letter-high
placed round the block, if they can be applied without the balls
touching them, will be found advantageous; if they cannot, pieces of
reglet, pasted on the frisket in the usual way, and taking a bearing
on the furniture, must be substituted, but the high bearer is to
be preferred where it can be adopted; these bearers equalise the
pressure on the surface of the engraving, and protect the edges from
the severity of the pull, which is always injurious to the delicacy
of the external lines. They also render the subject more manageable,
by enabling the pressman to add to, or diminish, the pressure on
particular parts, so as to produce the desired effect.

When great delicacy of impression is demanded in a vignette, it will
be found beneficial, after the engraving is beat with ink, to take a
small ball without ink, and beat the extremities: this will not only
take away any superfluity of ink, but will be a means of preventing
picks, and give to the edges lightness and softness, particularly
where distances are represented.

If the extremities are engraved much lighter than the central parts,
underlays should be pasted on the middle of the block, which will
give a firmer impression to those central parts of the subject: it
would save trouble to cause the block to be a little rounded on the
face, as it would give facility in obtaining a good impression.

When highly finished engravings on wood are worked separately,
woollen cloth, however fine, should never be used for blankets, as
it causes too much impression; two thicknesses of stoutish hard
smooth paper, in lieu of it, between the tympans is better: sometimes
even a piece of glazed pasteboard is used inside the outer tympan.
The parchments ought to be in good condition, stretched tight, of
a smooth surface, thin, and of regular thickness, so as to enable
the pressman to obtain an impression as nearly as possible from the
surface only of the engraved lines.

It is indispensably necessary that the balls should be in the best
order, the same as for the finest work; and the pressman should be
very particular in taking ink, distributing his balls, and beating
the block well, otherwise he will not obtain clear, uniform, good
impressions. If the block be small, and it is worked by itself, he
will find that he can take ink more uniformly in small quantities,
by first taking ink with a pair of regular sized balls, and
distributing, and then taking ink from them to work his cut with; and
this more particularly if he be using a pair of small balls. For this
work he ought always to have the best ink that can be procured.

A large wood cut left on the press stone all night is very apt to
warp; when this happens, a good method to restore it to its original
flatness is to lay it on its face upon the imposing stone, with a few
thicknesses of damp paper underneath it, and to place the flat side
of a planer upon it, and four or five octavo pages of tied up letter;
in the course of a few hours the block will be restored to its
original flatness. This method is preferable to steeping the block in
water, which has been frequently practised; for the steeping swells
the lines of the engraving, and consequently affects the impression
to a much greater extent than this operation. For retaining the
original effect, as it came from the hands of the artist, I would
carefully prevent the block ever being wet with water, and, when it
had been worked in a form with types, would take it out before the
form was washed.

To prevent this warping during the dinner hour or the night, turn the
tympan down upon the form, run the carriage in, and pulling the bar
handle home, fasten it to the near cheek by the catch, where there
is one, or else by a chain or rope, or by a stay to the bar from the
offcheek; in iron presses this way is efficacious.

However long a time boxwood may be kept in the log, it will always
twist and warp when cut into slices for engraving, on account of
fresh surfaces being exposed to the air: large blocks may be restored
to their flatness by laying them on a plane surface, with the hollow
side downward, without any weight on them, in the course of a night.

When only a few proofs are wanted from an engraving, good impressions
may be obtained with little trouble on dry India paper, with about
six thicknesses of the same sort of paper laid over it, and pulled
without the tympan. This observation applies to small cuts, and
those of a moderate size; if proofs are wanted from large ones, it
will be found advantageous to put the India paper for a few minutes
into a heap of damp paper.

A fine engraving on wood should never be brushed over with lye: the
best method that I have found in practice, is to wipe the ink off
with a piece of fine woollen cloth damped with spirits of turpentine;
and if it should get foul in working, to clean it with a softish
brush and spirits of turpentine. It will be found in practice that
spirits of turpentine take off the ink quicker, and affect the wood
less, than any other article used; and the facility with which the
block is again brought into a working state, more than compensates
for the trifling additional expense incurred, as nothing more is
required than to wipe the surface dry, and to pull two or three
impressions on dry waste paper.

The engravers always show an impression when the block is taken home
to their employer; and this impression is taken in a manner, where
the subject is not of a large size, such as to produce a superior
effect to what a printer can with a press, when he has a number to
do, which are generally worked in a form with types, and his price so
low for printing, as not to enable him to do justice to the subjects.
This causes great dissatisfaction to his employer, and he is unable
to remedy the grievance; for the engraver’s proof is obtained by
means of a burnisher, with one thickness of paper in addition to that
printed on, so that he can examine each part to bring it up where
it is required, and leave the others as delicate as he pleases: he
thus obtains an impression from the surface only, perfect in all its
parts, with the best ink that can be procured; while the printer
gives dissatisfaction, because he cannot, in the way of trade,
perform impossibilities.

Papillon, in his work on Engraving on Wood, published in 1766,
complains of a plan nearly similar being adopted by the French
engravers, with which he finds great fault. The following is a
translation of the passage:--

“Some engravers on wood have the knack of fabricating the proofs
of their engravings far more delicately, and in a more flattering
manner than they really ought to be; and this is the means they
make use of--they first take off two or three, in order to adjust
one of them to their fancy, and which they think will favour their
imposition; having selected it, they only beat anew the parts of the
block charged with shades and the deeper strokes, in such a manner,
that the lighter ones, distances, &c. being only lightly covered with
ink, in as far as not being touched in the new beating, they retain
no more than what was left by the preceding impression; the result
is, that the new proof comes off extremely delicate in those places,
and appears pleasing to the eye; but when this block is printed in
conjunction with letterpress, the impressions then appear in their
natural state, and totally different from that which they presented
on delivery of the work. The strokes are of one equal tint, hard, and
devoid of softness, and the distances are often less delicate than
the foregrounds. I shall risk little by saying that all the three Le
Sueurs have made use of this trick.”

The pressman will find it an advantage, if it be necessary to do full
justice to an engraving, to have a good impression from the engraver,
and place it before him as a pattern, and then arrange the overlays,
&c., till he produces a facsimile in effect; but the most valuable
lesson will be when he can obtain the assistance of the artist at
the press side, to direct him in making ready the cut, and I would
advise him by no means to be impatient at the tediousness of the
operation, as he will obtain more information how to produce a fine
impression by this than by any other means. It will also instruct him
how to meet the wishes of the draftsman and the engraver, with regard
to effect, in a way superior to any other; and will, with care and
attention, ultimately lead him to excellence in printing engravings
on wood.

An assertion is now generally promulgated, that machine printing
is superior to that of the press, even for engravings on wood, and
thus misleading publishers and the public. When I come to speak
of machines, and of presses, I will endeavour to show that it is
incompatible with the principle of a machine that it can equal a
press in producing fine work.


ERRAND BOY. _See_ DEVIL.


ERRATA.

A list of errors that have escaped both the author and the printer.
It is generally printed in a small type at the end of the work. It
should always be kept down, and never brought out in a prominent
manner. Some authors seem partial to extend the errata, by noticing
the most trifling mistakes, such for instance as a turned letter,
and adding corrections of the writing and of misstatements of facts,
as well as new facts which may have arisen; and all under the name
errata, as if they were entirely the errors of the printer; in
this case they ought to be styled Corrections and Additions. In my
opinion, there is no occasion to insert in the errata any thing that
does not affect the sense. Mr. Beloe, in his Anecdotes of Literature,
states that “the book which is distinguished by the greatest number
of errata on record, is that containing the works of Pica Mirandula,
printed at Strasburgh in 1507, by a printer of the name of Knoblouch.
The errata of this volume occupy no less than fifteen folio pages.”

  24. ፀ:   ’Zappa.  _’z_,   צ
  25. ፈ:   Aph.     _f_,    פ
  26. ፐ:   Psa.     _p_,    פ

Of these ጰ: and ፐ: are used only in words of Greek and Latin origin.
In expressing Arabic these seven, ሰ: ተ: ነ: ከ: ዘ: ደ: ጠ:, and in
Portuguese and Italian these three, መ: በ: and ለ:, are made use of
with the addition of certain horns.

Moreover, none of the above letters are connected, except ገ:, which,
in the name of God, sometimes coalesces with ዘ:, in this manner ̛ዘ:,
as ለ̛ዘለበሐረ:

The power of the letters approaches nearest to those which have been
added, whence it appears that ሀ: ሐ: and ኀ:, also ሠ: and ሰ:, also አ:
and ዐ:, and lastly ጸ: and ፀ:, are generally pronounced in the same
manner, which causes no small confusion in writing, as one cognate
letter is often put for another, so that it should always be borne in
mind in looking for a word in the lexicon, that if it is not to be
found under one letter, we should continue our researches under the
cognate.

These four ቀ:, ጠ:, ጰ:, and ጸ: or ፀ:, have a sound altogether at
variance with European custom, and the correct pronunciation can only
be learnt by hearing. But one destitute of a preceptor may approach
nearer to their genuine sounds, by first prefixing to each the power
of the vowel _i_, thus, _ik_, _it_, _ip_, _iz_, and afterwards,
having substituted in its place an apostrophe, he may add the vowels,
in this manner _’k-a_, _’k-e_, _’k-i_, &c., and similarly with
_’t-a_, _’p-a_, _’z-a_, &c.

In Ethiopic the numbers are not represented by the letters, but by
certain peculiar figures formed apparently from the Greek letters,
and which are included within two small lines, in the following
manner:--

[Illustration: Ethiopic numerals]

    1.  ፩:   α’
    2.  ፪:   β’

  1000. ፲፻:   because in writing and speaking they say
              ዐሠረፑ: ምላት: _ten hundreds_.

  [Where blanks occur in the Ethiopic, the characters are not in
  the British founderies.]

The other numbers are compounded from these, the greater being always
placed first, as as ፲፩: 11. ፲፪: 12. &c. ፳፩: 21. ፳፪: 22. &c. ፻፩: 101.
፻፪:102.

In Ethiopic the vowels are not expressed by particular letters, as in
the European, or by separate points, as in the Oriental languages,
but by certain small lines or circles annexed to the top, middle, or
bottom of the letters themselves, or by the shortening or lengthening
of one of the strokes, which changes are in number seven; whence
arise so many orders of letters, or rather of syllables, of which
the first is considered as the simple figure, and the remainder as
compound, and are read--the first by _a_ short, the second by _u_,
the third by _i_, the fourth by _a_ long, the fifth by _e_ long, the
sixth by _e_ or _y_ short, and the seventh by _o_; in this manner:

The diphthongs are formed not only by the letters ው: and ይ:, mutes
of the sixth order, after a letter of the first or fourth order, as,
for instance, አውራኀ: _months_, ተሠይመ _it is appointed_; but also the
four letters ቀ: ኀ: ከ: and ገ: with the addition of certain peculiar
points, are generally considered to form diphthongs in the first,
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth orders, in this manner:

In Ethiopic each separate word is distinguished by two thick points,
and the periods by four or more; there are no marks of accentuation.

The preceding observations are extracted from a small treatise on
the elements of Ethiopic grammar by George Otho, professor of the
Greek and Oriental languages at Marburg in Hesse Cassel, with an
acknowledgment of being indebted for his information to Ludolph; and
bound in connexion with the “Fundamenta Punctationis Linguæ Sanctæ”
of Jacob Alting, printed at Frankfort on the Main, in 2 vols., 1717.

ETRUSCAN.

The confines of ancient Etruria bordered closely upon the city of
Rome, being separated from it only by the Tyber to the south-east and
south. There is proof, indeed, that almost all Italy was at one time
under the power of Etruria.

Although the Etrurians seem to have arrived at the highest point of
civilization, and even of luxury, at an early period, whilst Rome had
as yet no existence, and to have been distinguished in a variety of
respects far beyond the people of surrounding nations, we are almost
wholly ignorant of their history, and even their origin is involved
in the greatest doubt.

The people of Etruria, called by the Romans Etrusci or Tusci, are
styled Tyrrheni or Tyrseni by the Greek historians.

The difficulties of the Etruscan question are increased by a
difference of statement and of opinion in the accounts recorded
on the subject, by Herodotus and Dionysius, two of the greatest
antiquaries and historians of ancient times.

Herodotus, who, says Athenæus (lib. xii.), obtained his account from
Lydians, gives to the Tyrrheni a Lydian origin, and states that they
emigrated under the command of Tyrrhenus, one of the sons of Atys:
while Dionysius, partly because Xanthus, an historian of Lydia, is
silent respecting this emigration, will not allow the tradition
to be true, but imagines them to have come from the north. It is
not improbable that both are in part correct: the earlier portion
of the Etrurians might have come from the north, while the later
colony (who must have been advanced in civilization to have effected
the voyage) might have been Lydians; and in all probability these
subsequent settlers constituted the dominant portion of the invaders
of Etruria.--_Sir William Gell’s Topography of Rome_, 8vo. 1834.

The Etruscan language must have been the same, or nearly so, with
the Hebrew and Phœnician. For, whether we consider them as descended
from Ashur, Peleg, the Egyptians, Phœnicians, or even Celtes, and
from some of these they undoubtedly descended, their language must
have been either the same with the Hebrew and Phœnician, or nearly
related to them. The first Pelasgic settlements in Etruria could not
have been many centuries after the deluge, and very few after the
dispersion; and at that time the languages, or rather dialects, of
the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Celtes, Syrians, Arabs, &c.,
must have approached extremely near to the Hebrews and Phœnicians,
which the learned allow to have been almost the same. With regard to
the Canaanites or Phœnicians migrating into Etruria, after the first
colonies of the Pelasgi or Tyrsenians settled there, it cannot be
denied, that their language had received but little alteration from
the primitive Hebrew. So that both sacred and profane history concur
to evince the Hebrew, Phœnician, and Etruscan tongues to have been,
in the earlier ages, nearly the same.

This likewise farther appears from the letters and manner of writing
anciently used in Etruria. The letters are almost the same with those
of the earliest Greeks, brought by Cadmus out of Phœnicia. The manner
of writing is purely Oriental, the letters being drawn from the right
hand to the left, consonant to the practice of the Eastern nations.
The former point is rendered indisputably clear by the Eugubian
tables, in conjunction with the Sigean inscription, and the latter
by a bare perusal of the generality of the Etruscan inscriptions.
Nay, the very remote antiquity of the first colonies that settled
in Etruria, as well as of the Etruscan language and alphabet, may
be easily inferred from those inscriptions. For as the Pelasgic
alphabet, that prevailed in Greece before the age of Deucalion,
consisted of sixteen letters, the Etruscan or Pelasgic alphabet,
first brought into Italy, composed of only thirteen letters, must
have preceded the reign of that prince. The high, not to say almost
incredible, antiquity of the Etruscan language and alphabet, has been
clearly evinced in two dissertations, by Mr. J. Swinton, printed at
Oxford in the year 1746.--_Univ. Hist._ 8vo. vol. xvi. 1748.

The author of a “Tour to the Sepulchres of Etruria, in 1839,” in a
visit to General Galassi’s museum at Rome, says, “If we had been
surprised at Campanari’s exhibition, we were petrified at the
general’s. Here we saw an immense breastplate of gold, which had been
fastened on each shoulder by a most delicately wrought gold fibula,
with chains like those now made at Trichinopoly. The breastplate was
stamped with a variety of arabesques and small patterns, as usual
in the Egyptian style. The head had been crowned with fillets and
circular ornaments of pure gold, and a rich mantle had covered the
body, flowered with the same material. In this grave also had been
found a quantity of arms, round bronze shields with a boss in the
centre which was stamped, spears, lances, and arrows; a bier of
bronze, as perfect as if made a year ago; a tripod, with a vessel
containing some strange looking lumps of a resinous substance, and
which on being burnt proved to be perfumes so intensely strong,
that those who tried them were obliged to leave the room. There
were many small images, perhaps of lares, or of ancestors, in terra
cotta that had been ranged in double lines close to the bier; also
some large common vessels for wine and oil, and some finely painted
vases and tazze, with black figures upon a red ground, which had been
consecrated to the dead. There were wheels of a car upon which the
bier had been brought into the sepulchre, and many other things which
I do not remember; but the wonder of all these treasures was a sort
of inkstand of terra cotta, which had served as a schoolmaster’s A.
B. C. On it were the Etruscan letters, first in alphabet, and then
in syllables, and both the letters and the syllables are the same as
the oldest form of the Greek. It was deciphered by Dr. Lepsius, and
is the key to all we at present know, and will be the basis of all
we are ever likely to know, of the Etruscan tongue.”----“This humble
article is likely to prove to Europe, what the stones of Alexandria
and Rosetta have been before it, the dictionary of a lost language,
and the interpreter of an extinct race.”

“I noted that upon this inkstand were four alphabets engraved, and
after each the syllables,--thus, ba, be, bi, &c., ma, me, mi, and
so forth; that one of these is in the oldest or archaic form of the
Greek alphabetic letters, and that hence connexion is likely to be
traced and demonstrated between the Egyptian, Etruscan, and Pelasgic.”

EVEN LINES.

When a piece of printing has to be executed in great haste, a
number of compositors are employed on it, and the copy is cut into
small pieces for each, to facilitate the making-up, imposing, and
the general furthering of the work; if the copy should be in long
paragraphs, the compositors have each to begin a line and to make
their copy end a line, frequently with great irregularity of spacing;
this is termed making even lines. In daily newspapers it is of
constant occurrence.

The second, fourth, sixth, or any other even numbered page is called
an even page.

Before the introduction of printing into Europe, and its application
to the production of books, the Librarii or writers of books, in
Rome, were a regular company who had several immunities: their
business was a trade, and they were regulated by certain laws.
Besides these writers of books, there were artists whose profession
was to ornament and paint manuscripts, who were called Illuminators;
the writers of books first finished their part, and the illuminators
embellished them with ornamented letters and paintings. We frequently
find blanks left in manuscripts for the illuminators which were never
filled up. Some of the ancient manuscripts are gilt and burnished in
a style superior to later times. Their colours were excellent, and
their skill in preparing them was very great.

This practice, of introducing ornaments, drawings, emblematical
figures, and even portraits into manuscripts, is of great antiquity.
Varro wrote the lives of seven hundred illustrious Romans, which
he enriched with their portraits, as Pliny attests in his Natural
History. Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, was the author of
a work on the actions of the great men amongst the Romans, which he
ornamented with their portraits, as appears in his life by Cornelius
Nepos; but these have not been transmitted to posterity. However
there are many precious documents remaining, which exhibit the
advancement and decline of the arts in different ages and countries.
These inestimable paintings and illuminations, display the manners,
customs, habits, ecclesiastical, civil, and military, weapons and
instruments of war, utensils and architecture of the ancients;
they are of the greatest use in illustrating many important facts,
relating to the history of the times in which they were executed.
In these treasures of antiquity are preserved a great number of
specimens of Grecian and Roman art, which were executed before the
arts and sciences fell into neglect and contempt. The manuscripts
containing these specimens, form a valuable part of the riches
preserved in the principal libraries of Europe. The Royal, Cottonian,
and Harleian libraries, as also those in the two Universities in
England, the Vatican at Rome, the Imperial at Vienna, the Royal at
Paris, St. Mark’s at Venice, and many others.

When the art of printing was first applied in Europe to the
production of books, they were in imitation of, and sold as,
manuscripts; and blanks were left at the commencement of the
respective divisions of the work, for the illuminator to fill in
with the proper letters, and ornaments, as was usual in manuscripts,
and so close was the imitation that, even in our own time, it has
required the assistance of a chemical test to ascertain which was
manuscript and which was printed. When the secret of printing was
divulged, and the deception could not be continued, ornamental
letters of a large size were introduced, and printed with two
colours, generally red and blue, the letter being of one colour, and
flourishes, extending the whole length of the page, in the other, so
as to have the appearance of being done with a pen; then succeeded
various grotesque figures, in attitudes to resemble letters;
afterwards small Roman Capital Letters, with ornaments round them
forming a square design; subsequently the block was pierced so that
any letter could be introduced, and the ornamented part could be used
for any initial; the next descent was for the letter founders to cast
the ornament in type metal, and pierce it for general use, and these
cast ornaments for letters were called Facs, as an abbreviation, I
believe, for Facsimile. The last descent was to the extreme, to put a
plain Roman Capital Letter, frequently extending four or five lines
in depth; and this is the substitute for a beautiful coloured drawing.


FACE OF A LETTER.

The surface of that extremity of the type which bears the letter.


FACE OF A PAGE,

or FORM. The superficies of a page or form, where the faces of every
letter lie in the same plain.--_M._


FALLING OUT.

The same as DROPPING OUT, which _see_. But this term is more
generally applied to a page, a quarter, or a whole form, when any one
of them falls out of a chase from the shrinking of the quoins and
furniture.

In summer time particularly, forms in chase require to be frequently
examined, and the quoins tightened, to prevent this accident, and
more especially when they have been imposed in wet furniture.
Compositors should neither be negligent, nor forgetful of this, as
in the progress of a work the forms are in their charge, and if the
whole of a form, or part of it, falls out, they not only have to
distribute the pie, but to recompose the matter gratuitously.


FANNING.

This is a term used in the Warehouse, in counting paper. It consists
of taking hold of the right hand lower corner of a portion of the
paper between the flat side of the fore finger and the end of the
thumb, and pinching it tolerably tight; then with a twist of the
wrist turning the right hand edge of the paper up, and running the
left hand over the surface of the paper, it separates the sheets at
the top corner, so as to have somewhat the appearance of a fan, and
enables the person to count it with facility.


FAT.

With compositors, short pages, blank pages, and light open matter:
with pressmen, light forms, forms that only require one pull at
wooded presses; and very small numbers, such as five, ten, fifteen,
or twenty copies each, are termed Fat.


FAT. _See_ BEAT FAT.--_M._


FAT FACE,

or FAT LETTER, is a letter with a broad stem. For observations on
them and specimens, _see_ TYPE.


FAT FORM. _See_ FAT.


FAT WORK. _See_ FAT.


FEET OF A PRESS.

The frame of a wooden press that lies horizontally on the floor, into
which the cheeks and hind posts are inserted by means of mortises and
tenons.


FELT.

Pieces of felted hats. This is the best substitute for scaleboard,
when there is a deficiency of that article, to use as cards in the
head of a press; and even when there is no scarcity of scaleboard, a
few pieces put in improve the pull. _See_ CARDS.


FINE PRESSWORK.

This is the technical term for presswork of superior quality; it
is in some measure indefinite, for, as presswork is paid a certain
price for a given number, and the price advances according to the
time and care bestowed on it, that for which the lowest price is paid
is termed common work, and after the price has advanced about one
half in addition, it is styled fine work; although it may advance
gradually to six times the lowest price, or more, it is still called
fine work.

In aiming at excellence in printing, it will be found that Presswork
deserves particular consideration, as a part on which the beauty of a
book so much depends.

It will be necessary, in the first instance, to endeavour to define
more particularly what is meant by the term Fine Presswork,
for except this be understood, we shall come to no satisfactory
conclusion, as workmen vary in their opinions respecting it, and
frequently produce sheets of different shades of colour in the same
volume, when it is done at different presses, and all under the name
of the finest work; and when the same person either actually prints
the whole, or superintends it, the work will be executed according to
his criterion, without any fixed rule whereby to decide; thus one man
shall produce the finest work, according to his opinion, of a pale
grey colour, while another will produce it so black and surcharged
with colour, that if the ink be not of a very good quality, it will
not only smear, but the paper at the edges of the letters, nay, even
the whole page, will be tinged with the oil which separates from the
colouring matter of the ink, to the entire destruction of all beauty
of workmanship.

Fine Presswork is the art of printing perfect impressions from the
surface of engravings in relief.

By obtaining perfect impressions, I would be understood that the
subject transferred to paper should be an impression from the surface
and the surface only of the engraved lines, of such a tone as to
produce all the effect of which the subject is capable, without
either superfluity or deficiency of colour.

Having thus defined my meaning of the term Fine Presswork, I shall
speak of the means by which it is to be produced, which may be of use
to those who have not had opportunities of printing splendid books.

The press ought to be in the best condition, otherwise there will be
no certainty of the impression being equal, except with great trouble
and loss of time. The joints of the tympan should not have any play;
if they have, it will affect the register, which being out disfigures
the appearance of the book; it also causes a great risk of producing
slurs and doubles: the most certain way of having them without play
is to construct them on centres, so that if they should work a little
loose, they can at any time, with the greatest ease, be tightened by
means of the screws on which the centres are formed.

The parchments on the tympans should be thin, and of a uniform
thickness, and stretched on the tympans so as not to be flaccid. It
is said that the French printers in their finest works used silk
on the tympans, on account of its thinness, its smoothness, and
uniformity.

The face of the platen ought to be a true plane, and parallel to
the press stone, or table. It will be found in practice that an
iron platen is superior to a wooden one for producing a sharp clear
impression, where fine work is wanted; for, by discarding woollen
blankets, the pressure must be increased to obtain this effect, which
indents wood, and then requires so many overlays to make a uniform
impression, that they produce nearly the same effect as blankets, and
it becomes necessary to new face the surface frequently, which is
inconvenient and expensive: the iron platen is not subject to this
inconvenience; but it is more liable to injure the types, as it will
not yield; and should there be any inequality on the surface of the
form, owing to it not being well planed down, or to any extraneous
matter being upon it or under it, the types must give way, and be
destroyed. Generally speaking, the iron platen wears the types more
than a wooden one.

The head of the press should be so justified as to produce what is
termed a soaking pull; that is, the form should begin to feel the
pressure of the platen when about two thirds down; then, when the
bar is pulled home, or what is technically called cheeked, which I
would always recommend to be done in good work, as it keeps the pull
regular and uniform, the power slowly increases, and the paper has
time to be pressed gradually on the types, which causes it to receive
the ink on all its parts, and produces a clear impression.

This justifying the head relates to wooden presses, where the head
and the winter are allowed some play, which is filled up with pieces
of scaleboard, called cards, cut to the size of the mortises in the
cheeks, and inserted in them upon the tenons of the head, and under
the tenons of the winter, allowing the pull to have some elasticity.
For my own part, I would have the winter lie solid, and the spring be
confined to the head. _See_ WINTER.

In the iron presses constructed on the late Earl Stanhope’s
principle, where increased power is produced by means of a compound
lever applied to the screw, and where there is no elasticity in the
pull, this effect is produced in a greater degree than in a press of
the common construction; for, as the platen descends on the form,
the power increases considerably, but the motion is slower; thus the
effect of the soaking pull is preserved, with a considerable addition
of power, owing to the combined action of the screw and the compound
lever.

In Ruthven’s press, where the platen is suspended from the head, and
brought over the form by means of small wheels with grooves in their
edges running on the ribs, the pull is regulated by screws on the
locking pieces, and also through the springs by which it rests on the
ribs, that bring it nearer to, or remove it from the form.

In Clymer’s Columbian press, where the power is obtained by a
compound lever, the pull is regulated by a screw that connects the
bar with the lever, and additionally by thin plates of iron placed
upon the top of the platen under the bottom of the spindle. It is
also regulated in the same way, in the Albion press, as originally
constructed by R. W. Cope.

In Sherwin and Cope’s Imperial press the pull is justified by a wedge
above the head of the spindle or bolt in the front, which has a screw
attached to it with a projecting head, by which the pull is adjusted
to the greatest nicety, with ease and facility. Mr. Hopkinson has
adopted the same plan in the Albion press since it came under his
management on the death of Mr. Cope.

The advantage of having a good press will be unavailing for the
production of fine work, if the types are much worn; for it will be
found impossible to produce a sharp clear impression if the perfect
shape of the letter and the fine lines are rounded and worn away by
much use, as, in consequence of this roundness of the letter from
wear, it will be necessary to use much blanket in the tympan to bring
up the shape of the whole letter, which will produce a gross and
indelicate impression of more than the surface.

I have been told that Didot, of Paris, in his most splendid works,
never printed more than three sheets from the same fount of letter,
when it was sent to the melting pot, and replaced by a new fount.

The colour of the ink must depend on the taste or fancy of the master
printer;--but no, I am mistaken, for, unless he prepares his own ink,
he is obliged to use that only which is manufactured for general use;
and there is little if any choice in purchasing this article, when it
is wanted of a superior quality. Leaving the particular shade or tone
out of the question, I will state my opinion as to what the qualities
of black printing ink ought to be for fine work.

Intenseness of colour.

Impalpability.

Covering the surface perfectly of the type or engraving.

Quitting the surface of the type or engraving, when the paper is
pressed on it, and adhering to the paper.

Not smearing after it is printed.

Retaining its first appearance without any change.

Ink ought to be reduced to an impalpable smoothness, either in a mill
or on a stone with a mullar; and this is essentially necessary, as
the process gives it the next quality--of completely covering the
surface of the type, or the lines of the engraving, and that with the
smallest quantity; and, with proper care in printing, presents to the
eye an impression, in which the edges of the lines are smooth and
perfect, and the surface of the impression on the paper is completely
covered with ink, without any superfluity; which constitute the
perfection of presswork with types.

Another property required in ink is, that it shall not only cover the
surface of the lines on the paper printed, but that it shall also
quit the face of the type or engraving, and leave it quite clean when
the paper is impressed on it, and attach itself to the paper, so as
to give a perfect impression of the subject represented, without
the colour of the paper appearing through the ink; and that this
property, of quitting the type or engraving, and becoming attached to
the paper, shall continue the same through any number of impressions,
without any accumulation of ink on the surface printed from.

After having obtained these results, and when the printing is as
perfect as it can be made by workmanship, still something more is
requisite, viz. that the ink shall not smear on being slightly
rubbed; and that it shall retain its colour and appearance, without
the oil in the ink spreading at the edges, or tinging the paper--in
short, that it shall continue unchanged for any length of time, thus
preserving and continuing the beauty of the work.

The balls should be in good condition, otherwise the pressman may
exert his skill in vain, with a great loss of time and waste of
paper, without the intended effect. They are made smaller and stuffed
tighter with wool than those used for common work, which enables
the pressman to distribute the strong ink that is used with more
facility; they also cover the surface with ink better than if they
were softer, and are easier for the workman; for large soft balls,
used with ink made very strong with varnish and colour, would be
almost unmanageable.

The quality of the paper is of great consequence in fine printing,
but it is frequently overlooked by the printer’s employers, who are
too apt to pay more attention to a showy appearance and a low price,
than to quality.

The best paper for receiving an impression, as I have observed in the
article Engravings on Wood, is India paper; but as that which comes
to England is thin, it is not used for bookwork, neither would it be
durable, as it wants toughness to enable it to sustain much wear.

The next best paper for printing is French plate paper, which is
superior to English plate paper, as the latter has a good deal of
gypsum in its composition, which causes it to be very uncertain in
the wetting; for having given it a sufficient quantity of water,
judging from appearances and by comparison, and expecting to have
it in good condition, the pressman shall find it, when wanted for
use, nearly dry, and harsh, and the water unequally diffused; it has
then to be wetted again, and particular attention must be paid to
the turning and pressing of it, before it is in a proper state for
printing on. I attribute this effect to the gypsum, which has had its
water of crystallization driven off by fire in preparing it, and the
water which it takes up in wetting crystallizes to supply its place.
I do not say that all English plate paper is affected in this manner
by water, but I have repeatedly experienced it in practice; and in
the second wetting, if great care be not taken, the gypsum being
already saturated, it will imbibe too much water, which will squeeze
out in printing, and prevent the paper from taking the ink uniformly,
so as to spoil the impression.

The best English paper for printing on is that which is made of
fine linen rags, and moderately sized, without the use of acids in
bleaching, and without being adulterated with cotton rags: this paper
takes water kindly, is easily got into good condition, receives a
good impression, is durable, preserves its colour, and does not act
upon the ink.

Messrs. J. Dickinson and Co. have made great improvements in the
quality of paper, and manufacture one kind which is admirably
adapted for printing, being made by a peculiar process which gives
it a particular _affinity_ for the ink. They have also introduced
improvements in the manufacture which have superseded the use of
French paper with us, and have also nearly done so with the Chinese
or India paper.

Having thus spoken of what I mean by fine presswork, and of the
materials by which it is to be produced, I shall now proceed to
describe the process; for when a printing office is provided with
materials of the best quality, and the master of it is desirous of
producing superior workmanship, there is something more required--he
must resolve to lay in a fund of patience, as well as to submit to a
great and continued expense of materials, or else he will never excel.

A good pressman will, as a matter of course, be well acquainted with
the whole of the usual routine of presswork; in addition to which, to
form his judgment, he should make himself acquainted with the most
splendid books, and study them as patterns of workmanship.

In making ready it must be evident, that when a clear sharp
impression is wanted, the pressure should be on the surface only,
without penetrating into the interstices; of course the tympan ought
not to be very soft, neither should any woollen blanket be used:
the most perfect impression will be obtained when fine thick paper
alone is used in the tympans, and even of this article I would not
recommend many thicknesses.

After an impression is printed, the pressman examines if it be
uniform throughout; if it be, which is very rarely the case, he goes
on with the work; if not, he proceeds to overlay, in order to produce
regularity of pressure, and of colour, over the whole form.

To effect this object, he takes thin smooth paper, and wherever the
impression is weak he pastes a bit of it, of the size and shape of
the imperfect part, on the tympan sheet, and proceeds in the same
manner with every part that is imperfect; he then pulls another
impression to examine the effect of his overlays, and continues to
add to them where wanted, till the pressure of the platen is the same
in every part, and the impression is uniformly of one shade of colour.

If the impression come off too strong in parts, or at the edges or
corners of the pages, or on the head lines, it will be necessary to
cut away the tympan sheet in those parts, and, if that does not ease
the pressure sufficiently, to cut away the same parts from one or
more of the sheets that are within the tympans.

It is generally preferable to overlay on a sheet of stout smooth
paper inside the tympan, and particularly where the same press does
the whole or great part of a work: this sheet is cut to fit the
interior of the tympan, so as not to slip about, and has overlays
pasted on it where wanted, to bring up the impression till it is very
nearly equal; in all succeeding sheets it saves the pressman a great
deal of time, as he will be certain that when he pulls a sheet of
another form of the same work it will be nearly right, and he will
only have to place thin overlays on occasional parts to make the
impression perfect, with very little trouble. On the same principle,
where this method is not adopted, preserving and using the same
tympan sheet with its overlays, will be more expeditious than having
to repeat the operation with every form.

Where short pages occur in a form, the bottoms of them and the
edges of the adjoining pages will print too hard, and not prove a
clear impression; it will therefore be necessary to have bearers to
protect them, which are generally of double pica reglet pasted on the
frisket, so as to bear on some part of the furniture or chase; but
high bearers, made to the height of the types, are better, when they
can be placed so that the balls do not touch them during the process
of beating: in such a case they are liable to tear the frisket, from
their closely adhering to it by their inky surface and the pressure.
They may be placed where the regular foot of the page would have
been had it been a full one, to prevent those hard edges which would
otherwise be produced. This principle will hold good in all cases
of short pages, blank pages, and the edges of wood cuts; but where
it happens that some of the edges, or a particular page of a full
form, come off too hard, and where there is not room to place a high
bearer, then a piece of double pica reglet pasted on the frisket in
the usual way will answer the purpose.

It is not necessary that these bearers should be placed close to
the part requiring to be eased; they will produce the same effect
if placed at a distance, keeping the direction, so that they take a
good bearing on the platen, avoiding the frame of the frisket and the
points; in using reglet as low bearers, I would recommend that the
flat side of the furniture should be turned uppermost to receive the
pressure of the bearers, provided they do not bear upon the chase.

When a high bearer does not ease the pull sufficiently on particular
parts, its effect may be increased by pasting slips of stout paper on
it, as overlays or underlays, and a bearer of reglet may be amended
in a similar manner.

It happens occasionally that the tympan causes the paper to touch
the form partially on being turned down, and occasions slurs, and
this may occur from the parchment being slack or the paper being thin
and soft. To prevent this inconvenience it is customary to roll up a
piece of paper, similar to bookbinders headbands, and paste it on the
frisket adjoining the part; this roll of paper takes a slight bearing
on the furniture, and is a remedy. Many pressmen prefer pieces of
cork cut to about the thickness of double pica, and pasted on the
frisket.

It is neither customary nor advisable to fly the frisket in the
best work, and more particularly when large heavy paper is used; it
is a convenience in such cases to have a button screwed on the off
side of the frame of the tympan, to confine the frisket flat to the
tympan; it keeps the paper in its place, assists it in rising from
the face of the form, to which it adheres owing to the strength of
the ink; it helps to prevent slurring, and the paper from slipping,
which occasions waste when it happens: altogether the button is of
consequence in preventing accidents in the impression.

In working the white paper, instead of pins stuck into the tympan,
to prevent the paper slipping, a duck’s bill is frequently used: it
is pasted to the tympan at the bottom of the tympan sheet, and the
tongue projects in front of it, indeed the tympan sheet appears to
rest in it. The bottom of each sheet is placed behind this tongue,
which supports it while turning down the tympan. _See_ DUCK’S BILL.

In proceeding with the work the balls should be well cleaned, that no
dirt or extraneous matter may be on their surface. They should not be
too moist, which would prevent the ink distributing equally on them,
and would also prevent it lying equally on the surface of the types
or engraving; nor should they be too dry, as in that case they will
not dispose of the ink so smoothly as to produce a fine impression;
neither will they retain particles of dirt on their surface, but part
with them to the form, which will cause picks. The moisture ought to
be just so much as to make the pelt or composition soft, when the ink
will distribute kindly and equally, which will be perceived by their
lugging; they will also part with it to the form equally where they
touch, so that the impression will be sharp and clear.

The ink ought to be rubbed out thin and regular on the ink block,
so that in taking ink it shall at the very first be diffused
tolerably smooth on the surface of the balls, which causes a greater
probability of producing good impressions. It is likewise advisable
to keep rubbing the ink out on the block with the brayer, as also
to be almost constantly distributing the balls; the consequent
friction produces a small degree of warmth, which is of advantage,
particularly in cold weather.

As uniformity of colour is requisite for beauty in printing, I would
recommend that the pressman should take ink for every impression
where the form is large; this I am aware will be thought too
troublesome, but I am decidedly of opinion that it is advantageous
in producing regularity of colour: it is unpleasant to the eye to
see in a splendid book two pages that face each other, the one of a
full black, rather surcharged with ink, the other rather deficient
in quantity and of a grey colour; yet this must happen when, as is
frequently the case, three or four sheets are printed with one taking
of ink.

Beating for fine work should not by any means be slighted. The form
ought to be gone over two or three times, not with heavy thumps, but
slowly and regularly with a firm hand, just raising the balls each
time completely clear of the types, and advancing but a little way,
so that in fact each part will be beat five or six times over, or
more; the face of the type will then be completely covered with ink:
but the pressman should be careful not to beat too far over the edges
of the pages, nor, if the margin be wide, to let the balls scrape
against the edges of another page, as in both cases ink or extraneous
matter will be scraped from the balls, and accumulate about the types
at the extremities, and thus cause picks and rough lines.

In splendid books, and particularly where the paper is large and
heavy and the type large, set-off sheets are used to interleave the
whole impression while working, and are continued in it till the
printed paper is taken down from the poles, when they are removed
by the warehouseman. These set-off sheets are put in when the white
paper is working, and moved from one heap to the other during the
working of the reiteration. They prevent the ink from setting off
from one sheet to another while they are newly printed, which it
would otherwise do from the weight of the paper, and also from fine
printing being usually worked of a full colour.

For the uniformity of impression I would advise that the pull should
be adjusted in the first instance so as to cause a proper degree of
pressure on the form to produce a good impression when the bar is
pulled home, and then invariably to cheek the bar, and allow it to
rest in that position during a short pause; this is easily done in
the Stanhope, the Ruthven, the Columbian, and Sherwin and Cope’s
presses, as the increased power is obtained by a compound lever,
which is generally so adjusted as that the lever shall come a small
portion beyond the centre of the circle it partially describes when
the bar is pulled home, and as it has then reached a point beyond
its maximum power, it is easily retained in this position to rest on
the pull: the same observation applies to all other presses having,
what is usually termed, the increased power, which is the application
of a compound lever to a press on the common construction; but
in a one pull wooden press, instead of this application, which
I must acknowledge I never knew to answer well when applied to
these presses, I would recommend when fine work is doing a simple
contrivance that I adopted in two presses, which answered the purpose
uncommonly well, and enabled the pressmen to rest on the pull
uniformly, without too much effort to keep the bar to the cheek,
which with a heavy form and a large platen becomes very fatiguing to
continue through a number of impressions, if not impossible, with the
unaided exertion of the arm. _See_ CATCH OF THE BAR.

It will thus be perceived, that to produce presswork of a highly
superior character, great expense and much time are required; and
that it is requisite to have a good press, and that press to be in
good condition; to have new types, or types the faces of which are
not rounded by wear; to have good balls, and those balls in good
condition; the ink should be strong, of a full black colour, the
oil well boiled, to prevent it separating from the colouring matter
and tinging the paper, and it should be ground so fine as to be
impalpable; the paper should be of the best quality, made of linen
rags, and not bleached by means of an acid which has a tendency to
decompose the ink; the beating should be carefully and well done,
not in a hurried manner, the face of the type should be completely
covered with ink, without any superfluity, so as to produce a full
colour; and the pull should be so regulated as to have a slow and
great pressure, and to pause at its maximum in order to fix the ink
firmly upon the paper; these particulars observed, with paper only in
the tympans, perfect impressions of the face of the type only will be
obtained in the most superior manner, and a splendid book will thus
be produced in the best style of printing.


FIRE EATER.

Compositors who are expeditious workmen are styled _Fire Eaters_, and
also _Swifts_.


FIRST.

The pressman who has wrought the longest at that press, except an
apprentice, for he must allow any journeyman, though new come,
that style, is distinguished by the name of _First_, the other his
_Second_, these call one another companions: generally the master
printer reposes the greatest trust upon the care and curiosity for
good work of the First; although both are equally liable to perform
it. All the privilege that the First has above the Second is, that
the First takes his choice to pull or beat the agreed stint first:
and that the Second knocks up the balls, washes the forms, teazes
wool, and does the other more servile work, while the First is
employed about making register, ordering the tympan, frisket, and
points, &c., or otherwise making ready the form, &c.--_M._

At the present day there is no such distinction; both the pressmen
are equal, are equally responsible for the work, and take all the
respective parts without any distinction; unless one of them be an
acknowledged superior workman, and then he will, as a matter of
course, take the lead in making ready, but in nothing else.


FIRST FORM.

The form the white paper is printed on, which generally by rule
ought to have the first page of the sheet in it.--_M._ This is the
reverse of the present custom, which is invariably to lay on the
inner form first, viz. the one that has the second page in it; except
it is directed to the contrary, for some particular reason. _See_ LAY
ON.


FIRST PAGE.

First page of the sheet, which is always placed to the left hand in
the first or outer form on the stone, when imposing.--_M._ In Hebrew
works it is placed to the right hand, as in books printed in that
language the order of the pages is reversed.


FIRST PROOF.

The first impression of any matter after it is composed, for the
purpose of comparing it with the copy; it is usually printed on a
cheap hard sized paper, that will bear writing ink well, to mark
the literal errors, and any variations from the copy that may have
occurred, in order to assist their correction in the metal.


FIRST PULL.

In a two pull press of the common construction, the platen only
covers half a full form, and to obtain an impression of the whole,
the carriage is run in at twice; the first pull prints one half, and
the second pull the other half.


FLARING BALLS.

When pelt balls are too soft, from having imbibed too much moisture,
and are wanted for immediate use, they are flared; that is, the
pressman will take a sheet of waste paper, and having rolled it up
slightly, will light it, and holding the face of one of the balls
downwards, will pass it backwards and forwards over the flame,
and then treat the other ball in a similar manner: this not only
evaporates the moisture, but also communicates a small degree of
warmth to the balls, which causes them both to take ink and to
distribute it better than before the operation.

Composition balls are liable to crack, both in distributing, and also
when separating them after they have been left in the rack upon each
other, particularly when they are new and soft; to remedy this, they
are flared, which, when it is judiciously done, melts the surface of
the composition and fills up the cracks. They are also flared when
the face begins to fail, which melts the composition, and forms a new
and smooth surface.


FLARING A FORM.

In working by candle light, when imposing, correcting, or laying
a form on the press, it sometimes happens that melted tallow will
be spilt on the pages and choke up the letter. To get rid of this
tallow, and clean the form again, the compositor lights a piece of
paper and puts it on the grease, to melt it; he then brushes it with
the letter brush, and, if necessary, repeats the operation.


FLOWERS.

Types with ornaments cast on their face instead of letters. They are
used for borders round jobs, cards, pages, and wrappers of books; and
for other embellishments.

Luckombe, in his work on printing, gave many specimens of borders,
head pieces, &c. composed of flowers by Mr. Hazard, of Bath; and
lately, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Nichols have produced some large and
elaborate pieces with this material, by combining an immense number
of pieces of different patterns and sizes, to represent pillars and
arches; but after all the ingenuity they have displayed, and the
patience they have exerted, their productions are inferior to the
effect of an engraving; and only tend to prove, in my opinion, that
ingenuity and patience are misapplied.

Flowers are cast on bodies from a Pearl up to a Four Line Pica, and
of a great variety of patterns. Of late years our letter founders
have greatly improved their specimens by the addition of many new
designs.

The practice formerly was to cut the pattern perfect on each piece,
and many patterns had a line at the foot of each, so that when a
border was formed, there was a continual line round the inside. I
pointed out to the late Mr. Catherwood, of the firm of Caslon and
Catherwood, the inconvenience of both these modes of cutting flowers:
in the first case, when the pattern had a solid ground, the flowers
joined in that solid part, and, after being used a few times, the
angle became rounded, and always showed a separation between each
piece; I recommended that the junction should be in the most open
part of the design, so that a little rounding of the angle would not
be so perceptible: and in the second case, the same cause produced
the same effect; for after being used a few times, the angles became
rounded, and instead of a continued line, it became a series of short
lines, separated from each other by intervals: to remedy this, I
suggested to him to discard the line, and that a piece of brass rule
should be substituted by the printer, which, being in one piece,
would form a continued line, and not be liable to injury from the
same cause. He adopted both these plans, and the junction of the
flowers that have been subsequently cut has been much improved;
but the abolishing of the line has not produced the neat effect I
anticipated, for it rarely happens that the printer will take the
trouble of placing a rule within the flowers; in consequence, many of
the designs present, when printed, a meagre and unfinished appearance.


FLY.

_See_ DEVIL.--_M._ A boy who takes the printed sheets off the tympan
as soon as the pressman turns it up, for the sake of despatch: it was
most frequently done with newspapers, as they are always pressed for
time, and are obliged to work with the greatest expedition. These
boys are not now called devils, as in the time of Moxon, but _Flies_,
or _Fly Boys_.


FLYING FRISKET.

In working at press, the act of turning down the frisket and the
tympan upon the form by the same motion, for despatch; it is always
done in the regular way of working, but not in very superior work
where the paper is heavy.


FOLDING.

In the warehouse. As the person who collates the books turns them,
the gatherings lie ready to be folded, and as they are pushed a
little over each other they are readily taken up separately; they
are knocked up at the ends and sides, and evenly folded in the back,
which is rubbed down with a folder; after this, from a dozen to
twenty-five gatherings in thickness are knocked up together and put
into the press, which is thus filled and screwed down. After lying a
sufficient time in the press, they are taken out and are ready for
booking.

Books are never folded across a page; of course some require to be
folded the shortest way of the paper, and some the longest way.


FOLIO.

The running number of the pages of a work. When there is no running
title, the folios are placed in the middle of the head-line, in
Arabic figures, sometimes enclosed in brackets, sometimes in
parentheses, but more frequently now without either; when there is a
running title, the folios are placed at the outside corners of the
pages. The prefatory matter has the folios generally set in Roman
lower case numerals, and sometimes the folios of an appendix are done
in a similar manner.

A sheet of paper folded in two leaves, is also termed folio; as folio
post, folio demy, &c.; but when the size of a book is spoken of, it
is styled a post folio, demy folio, &c.


FOLLOW.

_See if it follows_, is a term used as well by the corrector, as
by the compositor and pressman. It is used by the corrector and
compositor when they examine how the beginning matter of a succeeding
page agrees with the ending matter of a precedent page: and how the
folios of those pages properly and numerically follow and succeed one
another, lest the pages should be transposed. But the pressman only
examines that the folio and beginning word of the second page, and
signature of the first and third page (when the reiteration is on
the press) follow the folio and direction of the first page, and the
signature of the third page follows the signature of the first page,
orderly according to the volume, lest the form should be laid wrong
on the press.--_M._


FOOT NOTES. _See_ BOTTOM NOTES.


FOOT OF THE LETTER.

The break end of the shank of a letter.--_M._


FOOT OF A PAGE.

The bottom or end of a page.--_M._


FOOTSTEP,

is a board nailed upon a piece of timber seven or eight inches high,
and is bevelled away on its upper side, as is also the board on
its under side at its hither end, that the board may stand aslope
on the floor. It is placed fast on the floor under the carriage of
the press.--_M._ It is made of elm; and gives the pressman great
advantage in pulling when he has a heavy form on the press.


FOOTSTICK.

Footsticks are placed against the foot or bottom of the page: the
outer sides of these footsticks are bevelled or sloped from the
further to the hither end, which allows the quoins to wedge up the
pages within the chase.--_M._ They, as well as sidesticks, which are
precisely the same, and used indiscriminately for each other where
the length suits, are made of oak; their width is in proportion to
their length; for a form of demy octavo the broad end will be about
an inch wide, and the narrow end about half an inch; but where a
chase is small in proportion to the size of the pages, they are made
narrower to allow of quoin room. Their height is the same as that of
the other furniture; the outer angle at each end is bevelled off. A
careful compositor, when he is making up furniture from the drawer,
will cut off the bruised broad end from the old side and footsticks
that will suit as to length, and thus economise the furniture, which
for jobs and pamphlets will answer every purpose of new.


FORE EDGE.

The fore edge, in making margin, is that edge of a sheet of paper,
which, when folded to the proper size of the book, forms its outer
edge.


FOREIGN BILLS or NOTES. _See_ FORGERY.


FORESTAY.

An upright support to the fore end of the frame and long ribs on
which the carriage runs. It is fastened to the floor, and screwed to
the frame.


FORGERY.

1 Geo. 4. c. 92. “An Act for the further Prevention of forging and
counterfeiting of Bank Notes.”

  “Whereas the Forgery of Bank Notes hath of late very much
  increased in this Kingdom; and as well for the Prevention
  thereof, as to facilitate the Detection of the same, the
  Governor and Company of the Bank of _England_ have, after
  great Consideration, Labour and Expence, formed a new Plan for
  printing Bank Notes, in which the Groundwork of each Bank Note
  will be Black or Coloured, or Black and Coloured Line Work, and
  the Words “Bank of _England_” will be placed at the Top of each
  Bank Note, in White Letters upon a Black, Sable, or Dark Ground,
  such Ground containing White Lines intersecting each other, and
  the numerical Amount or Sum of each Bank Note in the Body of
  the Note, will be printed in Black and Red Register Work, and
  the Back of each Note will distinctly show the whole Contents
  thereof, except the Number and Date in a reversed Impression:
  Therefore, for the better Prevention of the Forgery of Bank
  Notes, and for the Security of the Public; be it enacted by
  the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and
  Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in
  this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the
  same, That from and after the passing of this Act, if any Person
  or Persons (other than the Officers, Workmen, Servants, and
  Agents for the Time being of the said Governor and Company, to be
  authorized and appointed for that Purpose by the said Governor
  and Company, and for the Use of the said Governor and Company
  only,) shall engrave, cut, etch, scrape, or by any other Art,
  Means, or Device make, or shall cause or procure to be engraved,
  cut, etched, scraped, or by any other Art, Means, or Device made,
  or shall knowingly aid or assist in the engraving, cutting,
  etching, scraping, or by any other Art, Means, or Device, making,
  in or upon any Plate of Copper, Brass, Steel, Iron, Pewter, or
  of any other Metal or Mixtures of Metal, or upon Wood or other
  Materials, or any Plate whatsoever, for the Purpose of producing
  a Print or Impression of all or any Part or Parts of a Bank Note,
  or of a Blank Bank Note, of the said Governor and Company, of
  the Description aforesaid, without an Authority in Writing from
  the said Governor and Company, or shall use any such Plate so
  engraved, cut, etched, scraped, or by any other Art, Means, or
  Device made, or shall use any other Instrument or Contrivance
  for the making or printing any such Bank Note or Blank Bank
  Note, or Part of a Bank Note of the Description aforesaid; or
  if any Person or Persons shall, from and after the passing of
  this Act, without such Authority as aforesaid, knowingly and
  without lawful Excuse, have in his, her, or their Custody any
  such Plate or Instrument, or without such Authority as aforesaid,
  shall knowingly or wilfully utter, publish, dispose of, or put
  away any such Blank Bank Note, or Part of such Bank Note, of the
  Description aforesaid, every Person so offending in any of the
  Cases aforesaid, and being thereof convicted according to Law,
  shall be adjudged a Felon, and shall be transported for the Term
  of Fourteen Years.

  s. 2. “And whereas divers Frauds have been practised by making
  and publishing Papers with certain Words and Characters so nearly
  resembling the Notes of the Governor and Company of the Bank of
  _England_, as to appear, to ignorant and unwary Persons, to be
  the Notes of the said Governor and Company; and it is necessary
  for the Security of the Public, that such Practices, as applied
  to the Notes of the said Governor and Company of the Description
  aforesaid, should be prevented; be it therefore further enacted,
  That if any Person or Persons, from and after the passing of
  this Act, shall engrave, cut, etch, scrape, or by any other Art,
  Means, or Device make, or shall cause or procure to be engraved,
  cut, etched, scraped, or by any other Art, Means, or Contrivance
  made, or shall knowingly aid or assist in the engraving, cutting,
  etching, scraping, or by any other Art, Means, or Contrivance
  making, in or upon any Plate of Copper, Brass, Steel, Iron,
  Pewter, or of any other Metal or Mixture of Metals, or upon Wood,
  or any other Materials, or upon any Plate whatsoever, any Line
  Work, as or for the Ground Work of a Promissory Note, or Bill
  of Exchange, the Impression taken from which Line Work shall be
  intended to resemble the Ground Work of a Bank Note of the said
  Governor and Company of the Description aforesaid, or any Device,
  the Impression taken from which shall contain the Words “Bank of
  _England_,” in White Letters upon a Black, Sable, or Dark Ground,
  either with or without White or other Lines therein, or shall
  contain in any Part thereof the numerical Sum or Amount of any
  Promissory Note or Bill of Exchange in Black and Red Register
  Work, or shall show the reversed Contents of a Promissory Note
  or Bill of Exchange, or of any Part of a Promissory Note or Bill
  of Exchange, or contain any Word or Words, Figure or Figures,

  intended to resemble the Whole or any Part of the Matter or
  Ornaments of any Bank Note of the Description aforesaid, or
  shall contain any Word, Number, Figure, or Character, in White
  on a Black, Sable, or Dark Ground, either with or without White
  or other Lines therein, which shall be intended to resemble
  the numerical Sum or Amount in the Margin, or any other Part
  of any Bank Note of the said Governor and Company, without an
  Authority in Writing for that Purpose from the said Governor and
  Company, to be produced and proved by the Party accused; or if
  any Person or Persons shall, from and after the passing of this
  Act, (without such Authority as aforesaid), use any such Plate,
  Wood, or other Material so engraved, cut, etched, scraped, or by
  any other Art, Means, or Contrivance made, or shall use any other
  Instrument or Contrivance for the making or printing upon any
  Paper or other Material, any Word or Words, Figure or Figures,

  the Description aforesaid, or any Word, Figure, or Character, in
  White on a Black, Sable, or Dark Ground, either with or without
  White or other Lines therein, which shall be apparently intended
  to resemble the numerical Sum or Amount in the Margin, or any
  other Part of any Bank Note of the said Governor and Company; or
  if any Person or Persons shall, from and after the passing of
  this Act, without such Authority as aforesaid, knowingly have
  in his, her, or their Custody or Possession, any such Plate or
  Instrument, or shall knowingly and wilfully utter, publish, or

  as aforesaid, (without lawful Excuse, the Proof whereof shall lie
  upon the Person accused,) every Person so offending in any of the
  Cases aforesaid, and being convicted thereof according to Law,

  of Fourteen Years.”

FORM.

The pages when they are imposed and locked up in a chase are called
a Form; and this term is applied whether it be one page only or any
number that are imposed in one chase.


FORM DANCES.

When the lines have not been well justified, or if any thing at the
ends prevents them being tight when locked up, so that when the
compositor tries if the form will lift, and finds that quadrats,
letters, and spaces, or any of them drop down and will not rise, it
is said, _the Form dances_.--_M._

This term is more properly applied to a form when, in being lifted
from the stone, letters, spaces, or quadrats, will drop lower down
than their proper situation, without entirely disengaging themselves
from the form; this frequently happens.


FORM LIFTS.

After a form is locked up, and when, on being raised a little from
the stone, neither letters, spaces, nor any thing else drops out, it
is said, _the Form lifts_.


FORM IN THE SINK.

After a form is laid up, it is frequently left in the sink for a
short time to allow the water to drain from it; if another compositor
wants to lay up a form before this be removed, he calls out, _Form in
the Sink!_ that the person to whom it belongs may take it away.


FORM RISES. _See_ FORM LIFTS.


FORM SPRINGS. _See_ SPRING OF A FORM.


FORMULÆ, CHEMICAL,

are symbols representing the different substances, simple and
compound.

For the convenience of those who have occasion to refer to a
compound substance containing two atoms of base, (as, for instance,
antimonious acid in respect to its carbon,) the weight of two atoms
of the base is given after the weight of the single atom.

Professor Whewell in an Essay on the Employment of Notation in
Chemistry, observes, “I have no hesitation in saying, that in
mineralogy it is utterly impossible to express clearly, or to reason
upon, the chemical constitution of our substances, without the
employment of some notation or other. Every one who makes the trial
will find that, without a notation, his attempts to compare the
composition of different minerals will be confused and fruitless, and
that, by employing symbols, his reasonings may easily be made brief,
clear, and systematic.”

After criticising the foreign notation as being grossly anomalous and
defective, he adds the following list, which he hopes he has shown to
be mathematically consistent and chemically useful. He has used the
atomic composition adopted by Dr. Turner in his Chemistry.

Berzelius represents water (_aqua_) by _Aq_; for the sake of
simplicity Whewell says he has used _q_. He also observes, “In the
notation of Berzelius, the atoms of oxygen are indicated by dots
placed over the symbol of the base. Thus, _[..]fe_, _[...]fe_ are
the protoxide and peroxide of iron, which he considers as having two
and three atoms of oxygen respectively. This notation is compact
and simple, but it is not consistent with algebraical rule, so far
as the oxygen is concerned; and I conceive that, if this element
be explicitly expressed, it ought to be done in the manner I have
recommended, _fe_ + 2 _o_, _fe_ + 3 _o_, &c.”--_Journals of Royal
Institution._

I have omitted Professor Whewell’s reasons, which he gives to show
the superiority of his notation over those of foreign nations
and that of Berzelius, as they are not of practical utility in
printing; but I have given his list, which will be useful in printing
mineralogical works in cases where the copy may be bad.


FORTY-EIGHTMO.

A sheet of paper folded into forty-eight leaves, or ninety-six pages.


FORTYMO.

A sheet of paper folded into forty leaves, or eighty pages.


FOUL PROOF.

When a proof has many faults marked in it.--_M._ Pressmen are also in
the habit of calling the first proof a _Foul Proof_; and frequently
they pull it so as to justify the epithet.


FOUL STONE.

After imposing or correcting, if a compositor leave any thing upon
the imposing stone, except the mallet, shooting stick, and planer, it
is termed a foul stone; which in many houses subjects him to a fine.


FOUNT,

is the whole number of letters that are cast of the same body and
face at one time.--_M._ Moxon says this word is properly Fund.


FOUNT CASES.

Cases of larger proportions than those used to compose from, which
are kept to contain the surplus sorts of a fount until they are
required for use. In these cases they are more accessible than when
put into coffins and baskets according to the old plan, and are not
so likely to be mislaid.


FRACTIONS.

A fraction is part of a unit, and is written with two figures, one
above the other, with a line between them: thus, ¼, ⅚, ⅜. The upper
figure is called the numerator, and the lower figure the denominator.
The denominator shows how many parts the unit is divided into; and
the numerator, how many of those parts the fraction represents. A
proper fraction is when the numerator is less than the denominator.
An improper fraction is when the numerator is equal to, or greater
than the denominator.

A compound fraction is the fraction of a fraction, and is known by
the word, of, between the parts; as, ½ of ⅔ of 7/9 of 8/17. A mixed
number is composed of a whole number and fraction; as, 8-3/7, 17½. A
mixed fraction is when the numerator or denominator has a fractional
part; thus, 7⅔/4, 4/7⅔; or, when both of them have fractional parts;
as 5⅓/7⅕.

The fractions cast in one piece to a fount are ⅛, ¼, ⅜, ½, ⅝, ¾, ⅞.

Fractions are also cast in two pieces, from Brevier to English; when
wanted larger, they may be formed of figures of small proportionate
size, with a rule between the numerator and denominator.

This rule in separate fractions is now generally cast on the piece
containing the denominator, above the figure, thus, 1̅ 2̅ 3̅ 4̅ 5̅ 6̅
7̅ 8̅ 9̅ 0̅; but in improper fractions, where the numerator contains
more figures than the denominator, as 3848/21, this rule will not
cover the whole of the numerator, therefore it would be necessary, to
be able to compose fractions in a perfect manner, to have the rule
also cast under the numerator, according to the old plan, so as to
meet both cases, otherwise either the proper fraction or the improper
fraction must be deficient 21/3848.


FRAGMENTS.

After the body of a work, and the index are composed, the title,
preface, contents, &c. are proceeded with. If there be any pages
beyond the concluding sheet, they are now imposed together to save
presswork, and also warehouse work; and these pages are called
_Fragments_.


FRAME.

Made of deal wood, on which the cases are placed to be composed from.

[Illustration: Frame to hold cases]

By the annexed engraving it will be perceived, that the upper and
lower cases are placed upon the frame, not in a horizontal, but
sloping position, as two inclined planes, the upper case being
at a greater angle than the lower, which brings the more distant
boxes nearer to the compositor and thus expedites the work: this
arrangement occupies less room, and allows a greater number of frames
to stand in a given length.

The cases rest on a rail at each end, and in the middle there are
generally two rails, six or seven inches apart, for the inside end
of each case to rest on. There is frequently a piece of board nailed
to the bottom of these rails, which thus forms a depository for page
cords, copy that is not in use, and other small matters: this is
called a _Well_.

Frames are always placed with one end next the window, so that the
compositor when at work may stand with his left hand to the light;
thus he enjoys the full benefit of the light in picking up the
letters with his right hand. They are usually made to contain two
cases in length, which are generally a pair of Roman and a pair of
Italic cases, so that the compositor has not to go out of his frame
when he wants to compose a few words in Italic.

There is a rather strong nail driven into each end rail and each
middle rail for the bottom of the upper cases to rest upon, leaving
sufficient room for the lower cases to be lifted out when necessary.

The dimensions of a frame are--height of back, 4 feet 6 inches;
height of front, 3 feet 6 inches; width, 1 foot 10 inches; length, 4
feet 10 inches.

In a composing room, where there was plenty of room, I have seen the
frames made to contain three cases in length; this is a convenience,
as it allows the compositor to have up an additional pair of cases
for his notes.


FRENCH RULES.

Pieces of Brass, letter high, of different lengths and thicknesses,
on which are filed various dashes, swelling in the middle. They are
used to separate parts of a discourse; or are placed after certain
lines of capitals in titles and jobs, &c. They are also called _Swell
Rules_.


FRENCH WORDS AND PHRASES. _See_ PHRASES.


FRIAR.

When some parts of a ball or roller do not take the ink, so that
it does not adhere to the surface, the parts of the form that come
in contact with them will be deficient of ink, and the paper when
printed will, in those places, be either white or of a pale colour:
these white or pale patches are called _Friars_, as the black
patches, from too great a quantity of ink on particular places, are
called _Monks_.


FRISKET.

A thin iron frame, covered with paper, and connected temporarily with
the tympan, by means of joints attached to it and the headband of the
tympan, having iron pins to slip into them. The parts that are to be
printed are cut out of the paper covering; it turns down upon the
paper to be printed, which is laid upon the tympan, keeps it flat to
its place, preserves the margin clean, and raises it from the form
after it is printed. _See_ FRISKET BUTTON.

Each press in a printing office should have five or six friskets
attached to it, of at least three sizes--Demy, as the standard size
of paper; a size smaller; and a size sufficient for the largest form
the press will print, for it is very inconvenient, and a loss of
time, when the pressmen have to cover a frisket and cut it out for
every form they lay on: and more particularly when regular work is
in the house, and the same frisket will answer for many succeeding
forms. It is adviseable, where it is practicable, to have the frisket
joints at all the presses of one pattern, so that every frisket may
be available at any of the presses.

A pressman should never pull an impression from a form, without being
certain that the frisket is large enough, and that it does not rest
on the edges of the types, which would be destructive to them.


FRISKET BUTTON.

A button screwed on the offside of the tympan near the bottom, to
turn over the frisket and keep it close to the tympan in turning
down.

This button is only used when superior work is printing: it prevents
the sheet from touching the form partially, and also from slipping,
by confining it flat to the tympan, and thus tends to make better
work, and prevent waste; but it cannot be used where despatch is
required.


FRISKET JOINTS.

Two joints of the simplest construction, by which the frisket is
attached to the tympan by means of two pins, made with a head to
each, so that they can easily be taken out with the fingers; they are
inserted between the joints, and thus the heads face each other.

It is customary to place these joints on the flat part of the
headband of the tympan, which, when a large form is on the press,
and the rim of the chase is broad, rest upon, and prevent the form
receiving the effect of the pull. I have known great inconvenience
arise from this cause, in very superior work, where the chase filled
the press, and could not be moved to get rid of this grievance. The
joints should be taken off, and fixed to the extreme edge of the
headband, by which means they will extend beyond the chase, and the
evil be completely remedied. Where the frisket is fixed on centres
this inconvenience does not exist.


FRISKET PINS.

Two iron pins that pass through the frisket joints and connect it
with the tympan. They are made to slip in and out of the joints
easily with the fingers, and are put in from the inside of the
joints, so that the heads are opposite to each other. It is a common
practice with pressmen, when they have occasion to take off the
frisket, to lay the pins on the form. This ought never to be done;
for I have known an impression pulled under these circumstances,
at a good wooden press, without the frisket, and where the pins
were forgot. The consequence was, the destruction of types, and
the bedding in of the pins into the platen:--there was loss of
types--loss of time in replacing them--the platen to be taken off
and planed, with the expense of doing it, in addition to which it
was reduced in thickness full a quarter of an inch, and the further
loss of time while it was doing and hanging again, and justifying the
head. They may always be safely laid within the chase between the
quoins, where they can do no harm, and cannot roll off.


FRISKET STAY.

A slight piece of wood, generally fastened to the ceiling of the
press room, and hanging down to the fore end of each press, for the
frisket to rest against when it is turned up.


FROZE OUT.

In winter when the paper is froze, and the letter froze, so as
the workmen cannot work, they say, _they are froze out_.--_M._
In consequence of greater care in warming printing offices in
winter than in the time of Moxon, the workmen are not now “froze
out;” for there would be no excuse admitted for the non-execution
of parliamentary work, newspapers, reviews, magazines, and other
periodical works.


FRY, EDMUND.

A celebrated type founder, whose foundery was rich in Oriental and
other types for foreign languages, the forms of the characters of
which varied from the Roman character. Dr. Fry sold the whole of
his foundery to Messrs. Thorowgood and Besley, and which is now
incorporated with their previously extensive variety of types.


FUDGE.

To execute work without the proper materials, and where the workman
is obliged to substitute one article for another, and by contrivance
make his work passable: when such cases occur, they show the skill
and ingenuity of the compositor or pressman, in making his production
look well.


FULL CASE.

A case full of letters, wanting no sorts.


FULL FACED LETTER.

Types, in which the capitals, and the ascending letters of the lower
case, fill the whole square of the shank, so that the descending
letters project beyond the bottom of the shank. A full faced letter
is considerably larger in proportion than a letter of the regular
face upon the same body: they are convenient in jobs, as they produce
the effect of larger types, and take up less space.


FULL FORM,

or PAGE. A form or page with few or no breaks or white lines.--_M._
In a full form there are no short pages, nor blank pages.


FULL PAGE.

A page containing its full complement of lines.


FULL PRESS.

When two men work at the press, it is called a _Full Press_.--_M._


FURNITURE.

The term furniture includes all those pieces of wood that are used
in branching out pages, or jobs; in making margin for the folding of
books; and in locking up forms when they are imposed: it is generally
classed as reglet, furniture, side sticks, foot sticks, and quoins.
The height of it is five eighths of an inch, and ought to be the same
as that of quadrats; but the letter founders and the joiners vary
them both.

What is usually called furniture is in lengths of a yard each, and
commences with narrow, which is equal to a narrow quotation; broad,
which is equal to a broad quotation; double narrow; broad and narrow;
double broad; broad and double narrow; and narrow and double broad.
These are used for gutters, heads, and backs; to branch out large
jobs; to fill up with when a chase is too large, and to put round a
job when imposing, to keep the letter from the iron of the chase. The
bottom and two sides are flat, and the top has a groove planed in it
lengthways, the arc of a circle; this groove is said to be designed
for carrying the water off when the form is washed, but I cannot see
the utility of the groove for this purpose; its more obvious use is
to lower that part, so that the balls or rollers shall not touch
it in inking the form, which prevents the frisket tearing from its
pressure upon the inky furniture and from being continually lifted
up.

GAELIC.

The Gaelic alphabet consists of eighteen letters: a, b, c, d, e, f,
g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u. Of these, five are vowels, a, e,
i, o, u; the rest consonants.--_Stewart’s Gaelic Grammar._ 8vo. 2d.

“It may be explanatory to mention, that the syllable _Kil_ is
supposed to mark the residence (the _Cella_), in ancient times of an
ecclesiastical recluse; and that _Kin_, _Ken_ (_Cean_) means head.
_Ken_-loch-Spelvie, &c. the Head of Loch Spelvie, &c. The letter
_C_ is always pronounced _K_ in Welsh and Gaelic”--_Sixth Report of
Commissioners for Building Churches in the Highlands of Scotland.

GALLEY.

Pieces of thin boards of different sizes, with ledges about three
fifth parts of the height of the letter on one end and one side, for
the types to rest against; others are made with a slice to slide
out, and keep a large page on without disturbing it, the coffin
having several slices fitted to it.--_M._ The use of the galley is to
receive the matter as it is composed, and to afford a level on which
to make up the pages.

Galleys are made of different sizes to suit the different works on
which a compositor may be employed; if it be a reprint, page for
page, he avoids encumbering his cases with large galleys, but takes
one that will hold a page comfortably, completes his page, ties it
up, and slips it upon a page paper, and thus proceeds; but if the
work be not a mere reprint, and is done in a companionship, then,
as each compositor must be setting at random, the work will require
different sorts of galleys, which must contain more matter; in the
latter case he will take one of the proper width for the page, but
that will contain two pages or more, in length, or one double that
width with a ledge down the middle, so as to hold two pages in width.

For works in quarto or folio he must have galleys of a greater width,
so as to enable him to have a quantity of matter at random till he
gets the making up; in doing this, where the page is in folio and
large, it is safer to make up on a slice galley, when he draws the
slice out with the page on it and places it under his frame, and thus
proceeds till he has made up a sheet, when he slides his pages off
the slice upon the stone to impose them; he must in this case have
four slices at least. The following is a representation of a slice
galley:

[Illustration: A slice galley]

For newspaper work brass galleys are employed, the bottoms thin,
and the ledges of brass which are on both sides and one end, while
the other end has a moveable ledge which fits into mortises in the
sides; by this means the compositor is enabled, when a galley full is
composed, to put a sidestick and footstick to it and quoin it, and
pull a proof in the galley.

Galleys are generally made of mahogany: those made of the old panels
of coaches are held to be the best, as the wood, being well seasoned,
is less apt to split or bend, and keeping their flat level surface is
requisite.

GALLOWS.

In wooden presses, a frame made of two pieces of wood and a
transverse piece, placed behind the tympans, to support them at a
proper angle when they are turned up. The transverse piece is nearly
as long as the tympans are wide, so that the frame can rest upon it:
they are inclined towards the tympans and form an abutment, and are
placed in sockets so as to be easily taken out when necessary.

GALVANISM.

Another great discovery has been published, in addition to those
important ones of Sir Humphry Davy, which he made at the Royal
Institution, of the decomposing powers of galvanism, the brilliant
effects of which, I well remember, excited wonder and astonishment
in the crowded audiences that assembled in the lecture room of that
establishment.

The one that is the subject of the present article, promises to
be of great utility in the arts, by giving the means of obtaining
facsimiles of engraved copper plates, of engravings on wood, of
coins, medals, embossings, in short, of any engraved article, whether
in cameo or intaglio. The productions by this process have been named
_Electrotype_.

This is effected by placing the object to be copied in a solution
of any metal, when the galvanic action precipitates the metal from
the liquid that held it in solution, upon the engraving that is
to be copied. This precipitation or deposition assumes the form of
a cake of pure metal, with every line, however delicate, and every
inequality, however minute, on its surface, so as to form a matrix or
mould in the highest state of perfection.

When the matrix is thus formed, the engraving is withdrawn from the
solution of metal, and the matrix substituted; the galvanic action is
again renewed; a deposition of the metal upon the matrix now takes
place; and the result is, a perfect facsimile of the original.

This is a short sketch of the principle of this discovery. It
belongs to chemistry rather than to printing, to explain why the
metal is precipitated in a solid mass and not in a fine powder; but
such is the fact. The discovery has been applied to the production
of facsimiles of engraved copper plates with the most complete
success; and as it is now in a state of progress to produce copies
of engravings on wood, and pages of types, so as to be applicable
to letterpress printing, I will endeavour to give the present state
of knowledge with respect to this application of the discovery, the
process, and also specimens.

It is said that the discovery of this application of galvanism
originated in perceiving a thin deposition of copper at the bottom
of a galvanic battery, which, on being removed, displayed on its
under surface a perfect cast of the bottom of the cell, and suggested
an extended application. Be this as it may, the fact was noticed
by Mr. Warren De la Rue, of Bunhill Row, in a communication to the
Philosophical Magazine of September, 15, 1836, (vol. 9. p. 484,)
where he says, “The zinc plate is always partially covered with a
coating of copper, which, however, is not detrimental to the power
of the battery: the copper plate is also covered with a coating
of metallic copper, which is continually being deposited; and so
perfect is the sheet of copper thus formed, that on being stripped
off, it has the polish and even a counterpart of every scratch of the
plate on which it is deposited.” The discovery of the application is
claimed by two persons, M. Jacobi, a Russian, and Mr. Thomas Spencer
of Liverpool. The latter presented a pamphlet containing the results
of his discovery, and an account of his experiments, to the British
Association in 1839, at which time M. Jacobi’s specimens were present
and exhibited at the same meeting. Mr. Spencer has since prosecuted
his experiments, and liberally given the details and the results
to the public, in different publications; so that it is in fact to
this latter gentleman that we are indebted for our information on
the subject; but as it is now in the hands of a number of persons
of ingenuity and ability, who are prosecuting experiments on it,
there is little doubt but that it will soon be brought to a state
approaching nearly to perfection.

As copper is usually employed for engravings, and is equally
applicable to letterpress printing as to that of the rolling press;
as it is easily obtained in solution, and is not an expensive article
for this purpose, the process as here described is with that metal;
other metals have been used for experiments, and it has been stated
that articles in silver or gold may be produced with equal facility
where facsimiles of them may be required, but the production of them
in gold is doubtful.

In the process there are various things to be considered. Among
which may be particularly mentioned the fact, that the solidity of
the deposited metal entirely depends on the weakness or intensity
of the electric action. This action may be regulated by increasing
or decreasing the thickness of the plaster of Paris which separates
the two metals, and by the coarseness or fineness of the material.
Mr. Cooper states, “I made three similar experiments, altering
the texture and thickness of the plaster each time, by which I
ascertained that if the plaster partitions were thin and coarse, the
metallic deposition proceeded with great rapidity, but the crystals
were friable and easily separated; on the other hand, if I made the
partition thicker, and of a little finer material, the action was
much slower, and the metallic deposition was as solid and ductile as
copper formed by the usual methods; indeed the action was exceedingly
slow. I have made a metallic deposition apparently much harder than
common sheet copper; but more brittle.”

A friend of mine used a common garden pot, with a cork in the
perforation through the bottom, which answered very well, the copper
deposited being fine and tough. I think a wine cooler would be a good
vessel for that purpose, being porous; and either may be at hand,
when there is not a suitable glass, or any plaster of Paris.

Mr. Crosse has stated, in the account of his experiments on the
crystallization of metals, that he succeeded best when the solutions
were kept at a boiling temperature; and Mr. Spencer informs us, that
by keeping the solutions he employed at a temperature of from one
hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty degrees of Fahrenheit,
he was able to abridge the time otherwise required, three or four
fold.

In all scientific experiments, care and attention are requisite for
a successful result: in this instance, let an uninterrupted circuit
be maintained for the electricity, and let the wire have a perfect
metallic contact with the plates which it connects; when it is an
engraving on wood, bore a hole in the side of the block, and insert
the wire in it. The zinc may be with advantage occasionally taken
out of the saline solution during the operation, and cleaned in
water. In the choice and application of the plates, it is better
that they should be, as nearly as possible, of the same size, and it
is of importance that the zinc should be as thick as the required
deposition of copper, but it is easy when necessary to renew the
zinc again and again. That the solution of the sulphate of copper
may be continued in the necessary state, crystals of that substance
should be occasionally added. When the process is long continued, the
solution should be changed, for the sulphuric acid, which is set free
by the deposition of the metallic copper, prevents the further action.

This was the first method; the plan now practised, to prevent any
stoppage of the galvanic action by an excess of sulphuric acid
occasioned by the decomposition of the sulphate of copper and the
deposition of its copper in a metallic state, is to put into the
acid a piece of copper in connexion with the positive pole, and
thus, as the acid is set free by the galvanic action, it forms a new
combination with the copper, and continues the supply of the sulphate
without the necessity of changing the contents of the vessel.

In obtaining casts by this process, it must be borne in mind, that
no metallic deposition can be made by voltaic electricity without
the presence of a metallic surface or nucleus upon which to deposit:
but this metallic surface should be given only to the part which is
to be copied; the sides and bottom of the block may be covered with
a varnish composed of shell lac dissolved in spirit of wine, which
will prevent any metallic deposition from taking place upon those
parts, as also the moisture from penetrating into the wood, and the
deposition will in consequence be confined to the engraved surface.

In the management of the simple apparatus which is employed in
electrotype, it is necessary to have the binding-screws, wires, and
all the metallic surfaces, quite clean and bright, as also to avoid
touching with the fingers that part on which the metal is to be
deposited.

With regard to the first application of galvanism to the production
of facsimiles of engravings on wood, Mr. Spencer states, after
the publication of his pamphlet, “The wood engraving being given,
take a piece of lead the required size; let its superfice be about
one-eighth of an inch larger all round than that of the wood block.
The lead must now be planed, just as a piece of soft wood; (the tool
termed by a joiner _a try plane_ does best;) a clear bright surface
is thus obtained, such as I have been unable to get by any other
means. The engraved surface of the wood must now be laid on the
planed surface of the lead, and both put carefully in a press; should
the engraving have more than two inches of superfices, a copying
press is not powerful enough. Whatever press is used, the subject to
be copied must be cautiously laid in the centre of the pressure, as
a very slight lateral force will in some degree injure the process;
the pressure to be applied regularly, and not with a jerk. When
the pressure is deemed complete, they may be taken out, and if, on
examination, the lead is not found to be completely up, the wood
engraving may be neatly relaid on the lead, and again submitted to
the press, using the same precaution as before. When the lead is
taken out, a wire should be soldered to it immediately, and it should
then be put into the apparatus without loss of time, as the less it
is subjected to the action of the atmosphere the better: care should
also be taken not to touch the surface with the fingers.”

Mr. Spencer also states that plumbers, who have handled lead for
the greater portion of their lives, are astonished to find it so
susceptible of pressure. On the contrary, wood engravers did not,
until now, imagine that their blocks would stand the pressure of a
screw press on a lead surface without injury; but such is the fact
in both instances. In the manner in which box wood is used for wood
engravings, being in horizontal sections, it will sustain a pressure
of 8,000 lbs. without injury, provided the pressure is perfectly
perpendicular.

Mr. Spencer has omitted to mention the size of the engraving; if it
were one inch square, it would have a pressure of 8,000 lbs. on that
inch; if it were nine inches square, it would only have a pressure
of 100 lbs. on the square inch: with my experience of printing
engravings on wood, I would not venture to submit one to a pressure
of 8,000 lbs. to the inch for fear of crushing the lines. I mention
this as a caution; it may prevent an accident.

This appears to have been the first method tried to produce a
facsimile of an engraving on wood by means of galvanism, with a
metallic mould obtained by impressing the engraved block upon a
piece of lead. This not appearing to be perfectly satisfactory,
other persons were induced to endeavour to make the discovery
available for letterpress printing without the risk of injury to the
engraving, to which this plan seemed liable; and the next advance
towards the perfection of the process was an important one, being
the introduction of the real object intended to be copied in the
stead of the substituted mould, and obtaining a matrix from it at
once by means of the galvanic process without resorting to any
intermediate measures. This improvement was made by Mr. Robert
Murray, who proposed “in January last to cover the surface of the
wood with plumbago [black lead], so as to render it a conductor; and
then to proceed in the usual manner for obtaining an electrotype
copy,” as he informed me in a communication of the 21st of July,
1840. It is but fair to state, that this use of black lead has been
objected to by some engravers on wood, as having a tendency to fill
up the lines of a delicate engraving, and so to deteriorate the
impressions taken from it; but I am now furnishing the public with
the means of deciding on this question, by presenting an impression
from an electrotype copy, executed by Mr. Murray according to his
own ingenious plan, by the side of one from the original wood
engraving, and I leave it to bear witness for itself. I cannot
perceive any deterioration in the copy, nor any difference between
the two impressions: in fact they appear as if they were duplicate
impressions from the same engraving.

The following letter, addressed to the editor of the Athenæum, by
Mr. Spencer, which appeared in that publication on the 4th of July,
1840, details another method of obtaining a metallic surface for
an engraving on wood, &c. for the purpose of inducing the galvanic
deposition of copper upon it and obtaining a copper mould, which
appears to be free from the objections that have been raised to
gilding, bronzing, and to black lead.

“In my pamphlet, printed last September, I there stated I considered
the process comparatively incomplete, unless we were able to apply it
to the multiplication of models in clay or wood, castings in plaster,
wood engravings, &c., as the fact, that galvanic deposition always
requires a metallic surface to act on, seemed to set bounds to those
branches of its application. I then resorted to various expedients
to surmount the difficulty; among others, that of gilding and
bronzing the surfaces of such materials to a limited extent: this was
successful, but still troublesome and expensive, and, more than all,
the sharpness and beauty of the original was necessarily injured. I
have since attempted to metallize surfaces by the use of plumbago
(suggested to me many months ago by Mr. Parry of Manchester).

“Should I be desirous of obtaining a copper mould or cast from
a piece of wood, plaster, or clay, or, indeed, any non-metallic
material, I proceed as follows:--Suppose it is an engraved wooden
block, and I am desirous of metallizing it, in order that I may
be able to deposit copper on its surface (this example will hold
good for any other material), the first operation is to take strong
alcohol in a corked glass vessel, and add to it a piece of phosphorus
(a common phial corked will answer the purpose); the vessel must now
be placed in hot water for a few minutes, and occasionally shaken.
By this means the alcohol will take up about a 300th of its bulk
of phosphorus, and we thus obtain what I would term an alcoholic
solution of phosphorus. The next operation is to procure a _weak_
solution of nitrate of silver; place it in a flat dish or a saucer;
the engraved face of the block must now be dipped in this solution,
and let remain for a few seconds, to allow capillary action to draw
it into the wood.

“This operation being performed, a small portion of the alcoholic
solution of phosphorus must now be poured in a capsule or
watch-glass, and this placed on a sand-bath, that it may be suffered
to evaporate. The block must now be held with its surface over
the vapour, and _an immediate_ change takes place; the nitrate of
silver becomes deoxidized and gives place to a _metallic_ phosphoret
of silver, which allows the voltaic deposit to go on with as much
rapidity and certainty as the purest silver or copper.

“The whole process may be performed in a few minutes, and with
absolute certainty of success. The interior or exterior surface of
a plaster or clay mould of a statue, no matter what size, may be
thus metallized with equal facility. For the process of vaporizing,
and should the material to be acted on not be very large, I prefer
fastening it to the top of a bell glass receiver with a bit of pitch
or cement, and thus placing it _over_ the capsule on the sand-bath;
the phosphoric vapour is by this means equally diffused and not
dissipated. An ethereal solution of phosphorus also answers; and a
solution of either of the chlorides of gold or platinum may be used.
I am inclined to think this process, independent of its uses in
galvanic precipitation, may be applicable to other branches of art. I
would recommend those curious of testing its effects, to try a small
and sharp plaster of Paris medallion: dip its _surface_ in a weak
solution of nitrate of silver and _take it out immediately_; fasten
it to the bottom of a glass tumbler, and at the same time have a
little hot sand ready in a dish; lay the watch glass containing a few
drops of the phosphoric solution on it; now place the mouth of the
tumbler over all, and the medallion will be observed almost instantly
to change colour. The operation is now completed. A piece of pottery
ware in the state of biscuit may be acted on in a similar manner.

  “_Liverpool, June 27._                                THOMAS SPENCER.”


_Apparatus and process._--The annexed figure and explanation will
afford an example of the action of a voltaic apparatus, and will be
sufficient to render the subsequent details intelligible. A is a
vessel filled with a solution of common salt, which is a compound
of chlorine and sodium; B is a tube immersed therein, closed at
the lower end with a piece of bladder stretched over it and firmly
tied; this tube is filled with a solution of blue vitriol, that is,
a compound of sulphuric acid and oxide of copper. A plate of copper
C, and one of zinc Z, connected by means of the wire W, are immersed
in those fluids. The zinc decomposes the salt, with the chlorine
of which it unites, forming chloride of zinc, while the sodium of
the salt is repelled, and passing through the bladder, enters the
solution of sulphate of copper, which it decomposes, uniting with the
sulphuric acid and oxygen to form sulphate of soda, and setting free
pure copper in the form of beautiful crystals, which are deposited on
the plate C. The connecting wire W serves to convey electricity from
C to Z, and thus the action is maintained so long as any common salt
and sulphate of copper remain undecomposed.

[Illustration: Apparatus for galvanic action]

Mr. Spencer’s first attempt was made with a piece of thin copper
plate, which he covered with a cement of beeswax, resin, and Indian
or Calcutta red. The plate received its coating while hot, and on
becoming cool, the experimenter scratched the initials of his name
upon the plate, being careful to clear away all the cement from the
scratches, so as to expose the copper below. A piece of zinc was
attached to this plate by a copper wire, and the voltaic current was
set in action by means of the simple apparatus shown in the adjoining
figure.

A may be supposed to represent a glass vessel of convenient form. B a
gas glass stopped at the lower end P, by a piece of plaster of Paris,
to the depth of three quarters of an inch, Z a plate of zinc, and C
a similar piece of copper, a coin or any other metallic substance to
be acted upon; and these two are connected by a copper wire, W. The
inner vessel may be kept in its place by a cork, or any other means
that may happen to be more convenient. A solution of sulphate of soda
is poured into the gas glass, and the wire connecting the zinc and
copper plates being bent, as shown in the figure, the zinc plate is
immersed into the solution of sulphate of soda, and the copper plate
into the solution of sulphate of copper.

[Illustration: Another apparatus]

In a few hours Mr. Spencer, in his experiments, found that the
portion of the copper rendered bare by the scratches was coated
with the pure bright deposited metal, while those portions which
were still covered with cement were not acted on. It now became an
important inquiry whether the deposition would retain its hold on the
plate, and whether it would be of sufficient solidity to bear working
from; that is, supposing an etching or engraving to be made, and the
lines to be afterwards filled up with copper by the voltaic process,
whether such lines could be printed from.

In order to answer this last question, Mr. Spencer coated with cement
a piece of copper, and with a steel point endeavoured to draw lines
in the form of network, so as to penetrate the cement and expose the
copper. After this plate had been exposed to voltaic action, and then
heated, so as to get off the covering of cement, the copper network
came off with it. This happened many times; but by an accident it
occurred to the experimenter to employ nitric acid to the plate,
after it had been cemented and engraved on as before. It was then
subjected to the voltaic process for forty-eight hours, when the
lines were found to be entirely filled with copper. On applying heat,
and then turpentine to get off the cement, it was found that the
voltaic copper had completely combined with the plate on which it was
deposited.

A plate was then coated with cement, and lines worked upon it by an
engraver; but these lines were of a wedge-shaped form, leaving only a
hair line of the copper exposed at the bottom, and a broad space near
the surface; and where the turn of the letters took place, the top
edges of the lines were galled and rendered rugged by the action of
the graver. All this was objectionable; but another plate, similarly
prepared, and engraved on with a sharp point, had the copper
deposited on the lines; and this was printed from successfully.

This was an attempt to deposit lines upon a plate of copper by the
galvanic action, and thus form an engraving in relief, which I have
doubts of being successfully practised with finished subjects.

The application of heat separates the two metals, in consequence of
their different expansibility when subjected to its influence.

Mr. Spencer gives the form of another apparatus on a more extended
scale, which he recommends, as it may be employed in large works.

[Illustration: Larger scale apparatus]

A is an earthenware vessel to receive the copper plate and the
solution of sulphate of copper, in which it is to be exposed. B
is another vessel of earthenware or wood, of such a size that it
may fit into the outer one, as shown in the drawing; the bottom of
this vessel being formed of plaster of Paris, or some other porous
substance, which while it retains the solution of common salt may
permit the voltaic action to go on without impediment. C is the
copper plate to be acted on by the electricity upon which copper
is to be deposited. Z is the zinc plate, and the two are united by
the wire W, which may either be done in the manner exhibited in the
second engraving, or by the use of a binding screw S.

I have been anxious to give specimens of this discovery in its
application to letterpress printing, with some account of the process
by which copies are obtained from engravings on wood. I am gratified
in being enabled to do this, and to give two subjects, by different
processes in producing the matrices or moulds.

No. 1. is an impression from an engraving on wood by the late Mr.
Branston, which I give for the purpose of comparing the copy with
the original. From this engraving Mr. Murray, having metallized
the surface with plumbago, according to his method, to induce a
deposition of the copper upon it, obtained a copper mould by galvanic
action; from this mould No. 2. was produced by the same process, and
is an impression from the electrotype copy of No. 1.

No. 3. is an impression from an engraving on wood, from which a
matrix was prepared in type metal by the process called _polytype_;
this matrix was submitted to the galvanic action by Mr. Murray, and
the deposition of copper produced the electrotype copy from which the
impression No. 4. is printed.

No. 5. is a polytype copy in type metal from the same matrix as No.
4. These impressions are placed in juxtaposition, for the purpose of
giving an opportunity of comparing them, and forming a true estimate
of their respective merits.

There have been many attempts in London to obtain an electrotype
copy of a page of types, but hitherto, I believe, without success;
the difficulty arising from the deposition of copper getting under
the projecting parts of the kerned letters, and also penetrating
into the interstices between the letters and the words, and thus
preventing the mould from being disengaged from the types, without
using force and destroying a great number of letters. The following,
No. 6., is an imperfect specimen of a page of diamond types, by Mr.
Robert Branston, an engraver of eminence in wood, and Mr. Warren De
la Rue. There are many difficulties yet to be overcome in the process
of obtaining electrotype copies of types; but it will show what has
already been accomplished, and I have not the least doubt that the
combined skill and perseverance of Mr. Branston and Mr. De la Rue
will in a short time overcome those difficulties, and produce perfect
copies with ease and certainty.

The method adopted to procure this was as follows:--A mould in
plaster of Paris was first obtained, and a stereotype plate was
cast in it; high spaces and quadrats were used, to prevent as much
as possible the inconvenience before spoken of; a mould was then
obtained from the stereotype plate by the polytype process, in type
metal, and from that mould, by the galvanic action, the electrotype
copy from which the specimen No. 6. was printed.

In the first instance, the plan recommended by Mr. Spencer in the
Athenæum of the 4th of July, 1840, of preparing the surface of the
mould with silver, was adopted, but the sulphuric acid acted on the
plaster of Paris of which it was formed, and rendered it useless.

Since the preceding was written and in print, I have been informed
that Mr. Spencer has been more successful than the London
experimenters, for, in a letter to me, dated Glasgow, September 17th,
1840, he says, “Had I been at home I should have sent you a copy
of the first pamphlet, where you would have seen an octavo page of
stereotyping by the Voltaic process.”

In the present early state of electrotyping we find that, as it is
formed by the solution in water of a salt composed of sulphuric acid
and copper, it is of course thinner and the copper more attenuated
than type metal is when in a state of fusion; it will necessarily
penetrate into all the delicately engraved parts of a subject more
completely than melted metal, and must therefore produce a more
perfect facsimile than a casting; I believe this is undeniable,
for copies of copper plate engravings of great fineness have been
produced in the highest state of perfection as facsimiles. Another
point is, that copper is tougher than type metal, and not so liable
to have the letters break off and fail in the process of printing,
and of consequence will be more durable. But it appears to me that
one of its most valuable applications will be to the printing of
Bibles, for by obtaining copper matrices of the pages by this
process new editions may be multiplied to any extent, and when the
plates are much worn they may be renewed at any future time, without
incurring the expense of recomposing the book; which is not the case
with stereotype plates. But the applicability of the discovery is
as yet in its infancy, as these specimens are, I believe, the first
that have been published of impressions of letterpress electrotype
plates, and the ingenuity of man is at work to extend and improve the
discovery.

In giving the foregoing account of experiments that have been made
on this discovery of the application of galvanism to the production
of copies of the works of art, and more particularly with respect
to engravings on wood, as connected with letterpress printing, to
which this work is confined, it is evident that the persons making
these experiments are not availing themselves of the information
which may easily be procured, that is, of ascertaining what are the
requisites to enable a printer to make use of these copies in the
regular way of business; excepting this be done, the discovery will
not be available for general purposes, and will be viewed only as
a curiosity: one point, to which I would particularly draw their
attention, is the difficulty experienced in separating the matrix
from the original, and again of separating the copy from the matrix;
in both these cases they have the deposition of copper too thin, and
in the act of separation both the matrix and the copy are twisted and
distorted; they are then filled in at the back with some soft metal,
which is planed in a rough manner, and delivered in this condition,
unfit for the press, at which it is almost impossible to obtain a
good impression. I would suggest that the deposition of copper should
be continued for a longer time, so as to have the metal thicker, both
in the matrix and the copy; if any irregularity in the surface then
take place in the act of separation, it ought to be reduced before it
is filled in with metal at the back; when that is done it should be
turned in a lathe, as stereotype plates now are; it would thus be of
an equal thickness throughout without any unevenness on the surface
or back, and when mounted type-high might be printed without more
trouble than wood cuts or stereotype plates are; thus enabling the
printer to produce impressions without difficulty that would show the
merits of the discovery in a fair manner, which at present cannot be
done without great trouble and loss of time.

GARTER.

In wooden presses, two flat pieces of iron with a semicircle cut in
one end of each, and a projecting part at the other ends; in the
projecting parts there is a hole at each end, those in the front
piece for a screw to go through, and those in the back piece are
tapped to receive a screw.

The hose has a horizontal mortise through it, exactly at the groove
in the spindle; this mortise is to receive the garter, which, when
driven close up from back and front, clasps the spindle in the groove
by means of its semicircular ends, which are made to fit into this
groove; and the two parts are kept firmly together by the screws that
pass through the projecting ends on two sides of the hose.

Its use is to lift up the platen on the return of the bar, to admit
the carriage to be run in and out.


GATHER BOOKS.

Gathering of books is to take one sheet off every heap, beginning at
the last sheet first, viz. at the left hand end of the range.--_M._
We now reverse the heaps, and place the first signature where they
used to place the last; they then gathered, placing each sheet upon
the other: we now gather under each sheet, which is a much quicker
way. _See_ GATHERING.

GATHERING.

In making the printed sheets of a work up into copies in the
warehouse for delivery, a number of them in orderly succession
are folded together, which is called a gathering; a volume may be
complete in one gathering, or it may consist of two, three, four, or
more.

When there are more than one gathering in a volume, the warehouseman
endeavours to have the number of sheets in each nearly equal; and
he very rarely puts less than ten, or more than fifteen, in one
gathering.

He lays down upon the gathering table a heap of each signature,
commencing with B, or whatever signature the body of the work may
begin with, following each other in regular order, according to the
letters of the alphabet, and as many as he intends to include in the
first gathering, with the first page of each to the front of the
table. If it be a long number, he seldom lays down more than a bundle
of each signature at once, that the top sheets may not be higher than
the boys can conveniently reach.

The first signature is placed at the extreme end of the table to the
left hand, that if there be any space more than is actually wanted
upon the table, it may be at the end where the gathering concludes,
to allow the boys to knock up the sheets without crowding each other.

In commencing gathering it is necessary that the boys should have
clean hands, otherwise they will dirty many sheets with the end of
the right thumb.

A boy wets the end of his right thumb with the tip of his tongue,
and pushes up with it the right hand corner of the first sheet, the
fingers of his left hand being laid upon the sheet to prevent its
slipping away, and he catches it up with the thumb of his left hand
underneath it, and draws it upon the next heap; he does the same by
this, and so continues drawing the accumulating sheets in his left
hand over the successive heaps, and taking one from each, till he
gets to the end; he then knocks this gathering up even at the ends
and sides, and lays it down at the end of the table, which being what
is styled a horse-shoe table, he has only to turn himself round, when
he is again facing the first signature, to recommence the operation,
always knocking up his gathering, and laying it evenly upon the
other, till it accumulates to a pile.

In the regular routine of business, where despatch is necessary,
three or four boys are generally put to one gathering table, who
follow each other regularly, knocking up their gatherings, and piling
them up on the end of the table. Among them there is frequently an
inexperienced boy; to prevent delay, this boy is ordered to lay his
gathering down at the end, and the next boy knocks it up with his
own: if the boy has quickness and spirit, he exerts himself to become
expert, and to equal the others.

If the collation of the book is going on at the same time, it
prevents the pile of gatherings from accumulating too much; if it be
not, the pile must be removed occasionally, to prevent it getting too
high for the boys to deposit their gatherings.

They thus proceed till one, or more, of the heaps is exhausted, when
the remnant of the others is folded in the middle, each signature by
itself, and tied up in a bundle, enclosed in wrappers; but if the
book be collating, the drawn sheets are previously laid down, which
enables them generally to gather off a few more copies.

In the course of gathering, if a boy perceives that the sheets in
any of the heaps are turned the wrong way, he should immediately
announce it, that they may be placed right; he should be likewise
very particular to take one sheet from each heap, as also to avoid
taking two: any of these errors causes a great deal of extra trouble
in collating, and of course a consequent loss of time, in addition to
making the work unpleasant.

After the gatherings are collated, they are knocked up carefully at
the ends and sides, and folded evenly in the middle; folios, quartos,
and octavos, in the regular fold of the paper, and twelves the long
way in the back; for a gathering is never folded in a page, neither
lengthways nor crossways. They are then put into a press, a moderate
quantity being placed between each two boards, and the press wrung
well down; after having lain in the press a sufficient time, they are
taken out, and piled away till the work is completed, and they are
wanted for Booking.

If copies of a work are required to be delivered as soon as the last
sheet is put to press, which at the present day is commonly the
case, the warehouseman should be prepared to meet the wishes of his
employer’s customers, by having the book gathered close up to the
last gathering; having them all pressed and booked; and as fast as
the last sheet is worked off, keep hanging it up very thin in the
most favourable part of his poling for drying, and even dry a few by
the fire to commence with. He will thus have the last gathering only
to put together, and in some cases he may have part of that done; so
that if he put his boys to gather, himself to collate, another to
fold the gatherings and put them into the press, he may in less than
two hours, in a case of emergency, deliver fifty or a hundred copies
of a work without difficulty, and obtain credit to the house and
to himself for despatch and attention, both of which cannot but be
gratifying to him. _See_ BOOKING. COLLATING. LAY DOWN.


GATHERING TABLE.

A table in the warehouse on which the printed sheets are arranged in
the order of their signatures, in order to their being gathered into
books. It is usually a horse-shoe table, and the boys gather on the
inside, so that when they have completed one gathering they have only
to turn round and commence again. Where there is space enough in the
warehouse it ought to be sufficiently large to hold at least fifteen
sheets, with room at the end for the heap and for the knocking up of
each gathering.


GAUGE.

A Gauge, to regulate the margin, is used both by compositors and
pressmen, in their respective departments.

When a compositor commences a work, or joins a companionship, it is
necessary that he cut a gauge to the length of a regular page of
his work; to do this he should take a page without any chapter head
lines, of the regular number of lines, and cut his gauge to the exact
length, including the head and the direction line; a piece of great
primer reglet is a convenient thickness, and marking the name of
the work on it may prevent errors. Many compositors mark the length
of the page upon a piece of furniture, and make it answer for two,
three, or four works; but I have known mistakes occur in making-up,
from adopting this method, that have caused a great deal of trouble
in remaking up the succeeding pages.

In works that are printed with large letter, and have many head lines
in the pages, and much white between the lines, I would advise a
gauge to be cut on which the situation of each line should be marked;
this will enable the compositor to make up his pages, so that, when
the sheet is worked off, line shall fall upon line, which will add a
beauty to his work, and save a great deal of trouble, by rendering
unnecessary any alteration of the whites.

After the first sheet of a work has been imposed, and the margin made
right by the person who has the superintendence of this department,
a gauge should be cut to the exact width of the back, and another to
that of the head; a piece of thin reglet being used for each, marked
with the name of the work, and with the words, “back,” and “head;” a
hole may be made in each piece that they may be tied together, so as
to hang them upon a nail driven into some part of the frame; and a
fresh sheet should never be imposed without trying the margin before
it is locked-up. I am aware this is being more particular than is the
general custom; but, if a compositor adopt the method, he will find
that it will not take more than a minute of additional time, and will
eventually be a saving by preventing mistakes, and he will thus send
each sheet to press in a workmanlike manner.

The pressmen require a gauge in all folio works, in order to keep the
head lines of the pages of each sheet precisely at the same distance
from the edge of the paper. This head margin is determined by the
overseer, or master printer, when the first sheet goes to press; the
pressman should then cut his gauge, mark it with the name of the
work, and keep it in some secure place, to lay the succeeding sheets
on by, so that the work may have a uniform head margin, which, as the
bookbinder always makes the head lines range, will prevent the book
being reduced in size by cutting, an object of serious consideration
in a library.

GERMAN.

“It is generally admitted, that the ancient Germans had not the use
of letters, before their intercourse with the Romans; the testimony
of Tacitus is decisive on this subject. ‘_Literarum secreta viri
pariter ac fœminæ ignorant._’ Hence we conclude, that the Teutons,
who anciently inhabited the neighbouring coast, and islands of the
Baltic Sea, had no letters, till their descendants, who settled in
Belgic Gaul, obtained them from the Romans. The Teutonic alphabet
is evidently deduced from the Roman, and is nothing more than the
Roman varied by the Germans, which, having been much deformed, was
improved by _Charlemagne_ in the ninth century, and continued till
the twelfth, when this kind of writing was succeeded by the modern
Gothic, which prevails in Germany, and in several of the northern
countries of Europe at this time.”--_Astle._

In addition to the characters of the preceding alphabet, the Germans
make use of three, which are vowels: ~Ae, ä~ or ~á~, expressed by the
Roman character ä, and having the sound of _e_ in _where_. ~Oe, ö~
or ~ó~, and in the Roman character ö, which has the sound of _eu_ in
the French _heure_. ~Ue, ü~ or ~ú~, having its representative in the
Roman ü, and its expression in the thin _u_ of the French in _vertu_.

The Germans also make use of the following double letters in printing:

  ~ch~  ch
  ~ck~  ck
  ~ff~  ﬀ
  ~fi~  ﬁ
  ~ffi~ ﬄ
  ~fl~  ﬂ
  ~ll~  ll

confounded one with another. To facilitate the discrimination the
difference is here pointed out.

GET IN.

Matter is got in in a line, page, sheet, or book, if letter be
thinner cast than the printed copy the compositor sets by. Or matter
is got in if the compositor sets closer: or if he widens his measure;
or puts more lines in a page.--_M._ Also if copy makes less than it
was calculated to do, they say, it gets in. _See_ DRIVE OUT.


GIRTHS.

Are thongs of leather, cut out of the back of an horse hide, or a
bull’s hide, sometimes an hog’s hide. They are about an inch and
an half, or an inch and three quarters broad. Two of them are used
to carry the carriage out and in.--_M._ They are sometimes made of
Girthweb.

Mr. T. C. Hansard, in his patent for the improvement of presses, &c.,
enumerates “Girths,” of which he says,--“The girths I form of lines
made of any close-formed strong material or substance, but round
or narrow, and I particularly prefer cat-gut of about one inch in
circumference. Such lines I arrange in pairs, one pair to run the
table in, the other pair to run it out; applying them to the wheel
after the manner of leather or web girths; except that such lines I
place with a small degree of obliquity from either end of the table
to the wheel, so that in winding round no one coil shall touch or
interfere with the other, but take a spiral direction, one pair
giving place by being wound off the wheel as the table is run in or
out, to the other pair, which by being then wound round the wheel,
causes the table to traverse in the given direction. By these means
the rounce or handle will be, in every position or turn of the wheel,
equally tight, and no friction or adhesion of the lines can ever take
place.”

GIVING OUT PAPER.

When the warehouseman delivers paper to the pressmen, or to the
person appointed to wet it, for printing on, it is said, he has given
out paper for such a job, or such a sheet of a work.

Paper, for printing on, is received in three different ways from the
stationer.

The first and most general way is what is termed _Perfect Paper_;
that is, each ream consists of twenty-one quires and a half, making
516 sheets, which enables the printer to deliver full count, and
allows for spoiling sheets, which unavoidably happens in wetting, in
printing-off, and in the warehouse department.

The second is _Imperfect Paper_; that is, each ream consists of
twenty good quires, (termed inside quires,) making 480 sheets; but it
is given out to wet for bookwork as perfect paper.

The third is News Paper, which consists of twenty quires of
twenty-five sheets each to the ream, making 500 sheets.

Newspaper stamps are always received, given out to wet, and
delivered, by the net number, and require great care on the part of
the warehouseman and pressmen to prevent waste, as the master printer
is responsible for the deficiency.

Paper with outside quires is very rarely sent in to the printer; when
it does happen, the warehouseman should look over the outside quires,
take out the torn and damaged sheets, and give out as perfect paper:
but, perhaps, the best way is to put aside these quires, and return
them to the employer, as every sheet is more or less damaged.

The following Tables will be found useful, as they will enable the
warehouseman to give out paper with facility and correctness for
bookwork, and for jobs, where the numbers are irregular and the sizes
vary; and more particularly so, as they include both perfect and
imperfect paper.

Those for bookwork are arranged for the regular quantity of perfect
paper, commencing with so low a number as 12, and proceeding up to
10,000.

Those for jobs include the same numbers, and are so arranged as to
specify the quantity of paper to a sheet for each number, as I did
not think it necessary to calculate them to the fractional part of a
sheet: thus some of them are exact, and others have a surplus, which
in some instances is large where there are many on a sheet; but as
jobs are generally delivered without any surplus, I have thought
it best to give the quantity of paper that will make the nearest
specific number, so that it shall not be less, and leave the surplus
to the discretion of the warehouseman, or to the custom of the house.

Where the numbers are small in bookwork, the quantity of paper given
out is greater in proportion than when the numbers are larger; of
course a ream will not hold out in printing five sheets of one
hundred copies each, and still less in smaller numbers; for each
sheet at press will require a tympan sheet; and it is more than
probable that one or two more will be spoiled in making ready; and
in the warehouse department a file copy must always be preserved. I
notice this to remind the warehouseman to make a proper allowance
in his paper account, otherwise it will appear deficient, when in
reality it is not.

GOTHIC, ANCIENT.

The Scythian or Gothic tribes, descended from Magog, were the second
source of European population. They entered into Europe from Asia,
like the Kelts, about 680 years B. C. In the time of Herodotus they
were on the Danube, and extended towards the south. In Cæsar’s time
they were called Germans; and had established themselves so far
to the westward as to have obliged the Kelts to withdraw from the
eastern banks of the Rhine. They became known to us in later ages by
the name of Goths.

From this Scythian or Gothic stock sprung the Saxons, who occupied
the north-west part of Germany. We may here observe, the terms
Kimmerians and Scythian are not to be considered merely as local,
but as generic appellations; each of their tribes having a peculiar
denomination.

As a distinctive denomination, they prefixed to Goths the name of the
country they inhabited or subdued; as, the Mœso-Gothi, Scando-Gothi,
Norreno-Gothi, &c. Their chief seat is reported to have been in
Gothland, now a part of the Swedish dominions. The Mœso-Goths, as
their name imports, were those Goths that inhabited Mœsia, on the
frontiers of Thrace. The language of these Goths is not only called
Mœso-Gothic, but Ulphilo-Gothic, from Ulphilas, the first bishop
of the Mœso-Goths. He lived about A.D. 370, and is said to have
invented the Gothic alphabet, and to have translated the whole Bible
from Greek into Gothic. These Gothic characters were in use in the
greater part of Europe after the destruction of the western empire.
The French first adopted the Latin characters. The Spaniards, by a
decree of a synod at Lyons, abolished the use of Gothic letters A.D.
1091.--_Bosworth._

The ancient Goths were converted to Christianity by the Greek
priests, and they probably introduced their letters with their
religion, about the reign of Galienus. Towards the middle of the
third century, Ascholius, Bishop of Thessalonica, and a Greek priest
named _Audius_, spread Christianity among the Goths; the former
of these is much extolled by Basil the Great, and the latter by
Epiphanius. The ancient Gothic alphabet consisted of sixteen letters;
they are so similar to the Greek, that their derivation cannot be
doubted.

Those writers are certainly mistaken, who attribute the invention
of the Gothic letters to Ulphilas, Bishop of Mœsia, who lived in
the fourth century. The gospels translated by him into the Gothic
language, and written in ancient Gothic characters about the year
370, were formerly kept in the library of the monastery of Werden;
but this MS. is now preserved in the library of Upsal, and is known
among the learned, by the title of the Silver Book of Ulphilas,
because it is bound in massy silver. Several editions of this MS.
have been printed. See a specimen of it in Hickes’s Thesaurus, vol.
i. pref. p. 8. Dr. Hickes positively disallows this translation to be
Ulphil’s, but says it was made by some Teuton or German, either as
old, or perhaps older than Ulphil; but whether this was so or not,
the characters are apparently of Greek original.--_Astle._

[1] Ϲ, initial; σ, middle; ς, final.

There are twelve diphthongs or compound vowels, viz.

Six proper--αι, αυ, ει, ευ, οι, ου; and

Six improper--ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ, ηυ, υι, ωυ. The dot below signifies that ι is
subscribed.

_Accents._--Accents are nothing more than small marks, which have
been introduced into the language, to ascertain the pronunciation of
it, and facilitate it to strangers. Wherefore the ancient Greeks,
to whom it was natural, never used them, as is demonstrated from
Aristotle, old inscriptions, and ancient medals. It is not an easy
matter to tell, what time the practice of writing these accents first
prevailed, though it is probable not till after the Romans began
to be more curious of learning the Greek tongue, and to send their
children to study at Athens, that is, about or a little before the
time of Cicero.

Accents, by the Greeks called τόνοι, tones, are the rising or
falling of the voice in pronouncing: which may be considered either
separately in distinct syllables, or conjunctively in the same
syllable.

Wherefore there are two sorts of accents; two simple, viz. the acute,
οζὺς, figured thus (´), which denotes the elevation of the voice;
and the grave, βαρὺς, shaped thus (`), to signify the falling or
depression of the voice; and the circumflex, περισπώμενος, which was
formed first of these two lines or points joined together thus (^),
and afterwards was changed into a round sort of a figure like an
inverted Upsilon, thus (⁀), but at length came to be figured like an
s drawn crossway (~).--_Bell’s Greek Grammar._

The acute accent raises the voice, and affects one or more of the
three last syllables of a word, if it has so many.

The circumflex lengthens the sound, and affects either the last
syllable of a word, or the last but one.

The grave depresses the voice, and affects the last syllable only.

There are two spirits, or breathings: the asper (῾), which the Greeks
use instead of the letter Η; and the lenis (᾿) which denotes the
absence of the asper.

The apostrophe (’), marked at the head of a letter in the end of
a word denotes that the vowels α, ε, ι, or ο, and sometimes the
diphthongs αι or οι are cut off, the next word beginning with a vowel.

_Points._--A colon in Greek is a point at the head of a letter; as (·)

An interrogation is a Latin semicolon; as (;)

All other points in Greek are the same as in Latin.

[Illustration: Greek numbers]

The Greeks express their Numbers by Letters, thus:

  α’ 1   ι’ 10   ρ’ 100   ‚α 1000

  β’ 2   κ’ 20   σ’ 200   ‚β 2000

  γ’ 3   λ’ 30   τ’ 300   ‚γ 3000

  δ’ 4   μ’ 40   υ’ 400   ‚δ 4000

  ε’ 5   ν’ 50   φ’ 500   ‚ε 5000

  ϛ’ 6   ξ’ 60   χ’ 600   ‚ι 10,000

  ζ’ 7   ο’ 70   ψ’ 700   ‚κ 20,000

  η’ 8   ϖ’ 80   ω’ 800   ‚ρ 100,000

  θ’ 9   ϟ’ 90   ϡ’ 900   ‚σ 200,000

The first of the above ranks is units, and consists of the eight
first letters with the character ϛ’, called στίγμα, which
signifies 6, and is therefore ranged in the sixth place.

The second rank consists of tens, and is formed of the eight
following letters with this character ϟ’, κόππα, which signifies 90.

The third rank consists of hundreds, and contains eight letters with
this character ϡ’, σαμπῖ, which signifies 900.

The accent under each letter in the fourth rank signifies a thousand,
and the letter itself expresses the number of thousands signified.

The letters of the three first ranks are marked with a dash on the
top to distinguish them from the letters marked with an accent below.

By compounding the above letters any number may be expressed; thus,
ι’α’ makes 11; κ’β’, 22; λ’γ’, 33; ρ’δ’, 104; ‚αε’, 1005; ‚αψ’ο’ϛ’,
1776, &c.

Also the Greeks sometimes use these capitals instead of the numbers,
of which they are the initial letters, viz. Ι for one, because ΙΑ
signifies one (being formerly used instead of μ’ια), Π for five, Δ
for ten, Η for a hundred, Χ for a thousand, and Μ for ten thousand.
And these letters may be all four times reduplicated (except Π), thus
ΙΙ, 2; ΙΙΙ, 3; ΙΙΙΙ, 4; ΔΔ, 20; ΔΔΔ, 30; ΔΔΔΔ, 40, &c. So ΔΙ, 11;
ΔΔΙΙ, 22; ΠΙ, 6; ΔΠ, 15, &c.

Sometimes the above initials are enclosed in a great ∏, and then the
number is five times repeated, thus |Δ̅| is five times ten or 50; and
|Χ̅| is 5000: but Ι is never enclosed.

Fournier, in his Manuel Typographique, gives a great number of Greek
ligatures: these I have copied, with additional ones from Fertel, and
others from Jones’s Greek Grammar; together they make a more complete
list than any that I have met with. Fournier, speaking of the article
Greek, says, We see by the multiplicity of the sorts, that the Greek
character is the most extensive and complicated of all characters.
The founders may not always be able to give the Greek founts thus
complete in sorts; but I give the representation, because, as I have
before said, the engravers who have worked upon the characters have
followed the ligatures which they found in the manuscripts which they
imitated. There were never any but the Greek characters engraved by
Garamond for Francis the First, which have been complete in all sorts
of ligatures. It is this which has obliged me to give in different
lines the figures which compose this fount, in which there are still
some wanting, which I have been obliged to suppress in order not to
multiply them without necessity.

For the classical works in Greek the ligatures or double letters are
considerably diminished. I have adopted this usage in the little
fount, which contains but the figures most in use.--_Fournier._

I have been induced to give this extended list of Greek ligatures,
because the present taste in printing Greek is to discard them
entirely, and to use a distinct character for each letter of the
alphabet. Under these circumstances, should an old edition of a Greek
work be put in hand as copy to be reprinted, it would be mortifying
not to be able to decypher the ligatures, nor have any thing to refer
to for explanation. I have myself been placed in this situation in
a large house, with no person in it who could give me the necessary
information, although there were some there that professed themselves
good Greek scholars; neither could the editor of the work himself
give me any assistance.

GROOVES.

There is always a groove on the upper surface of the short cross of a
chase, at each end, six or seven inches long. Their use is to receive
the spur, when working with points, and to allow it to make a hole
in the paper, without injury to itself. The grooves in wrought iron
chases are of a good form, being cut with a tool tapering to the
bottom like a wedge, which enables the spur to make a clean hole in
the paper; those in cast iron chases are generally flat at the bottom
and too wide, which causes the holes to gull. _See_ GULL.


GUIDE CRAMPS. _See_ CRAMP IRONS.


GULL.

When the points tear the point holes at press, they say, they
are Gulled, or the Holes Gull. This may arise from two or three
causes--if the point of the spur be turned again, it will cause
it--in cast iron chases the groove to receive the spur is generally
too wide, this may also cause it--and if the spur does not fall
fairly into the groove, this may be another cause: the remedy is not
difficult, unless the paper be very tender. In the first case, the
spur ought to be filed to a smooth tapering point--in the second, it
is usual to wedge a bit of reglet into the groove, to cut it down to
the surface of the cross, and to make a hole in it with a bodkin for
the reception of the spur--in the last, it is necessary that the spur
fall fairly into the groove. If the fault arises from the bluntness
and thickness of the spurs, they must be filed smaller and to a point.


GUTTER.

Gutter Sticks are used to set between pages on either side the
crosses; they are made of an equal thickness their whole length;
but they have a groove, or gutter, laid on the upper side of them,
as well that the water may drain away when the form is washed or
rinsed, as that they should not print, when, through the tenderness
of the tympan, the platen presses it and the paper lower than
ordinary.--_M._ We now mean by the term Gutter, the piece of
furniture that separates two adjoining pages in a chase, as in an
octavo that between pages 1 and 16, in a duodecimo that between
pages 1 and 24, and so on. The pieces that are put at the sides of
the pages next the cross, are called _Backs_; and those at the tops
of the pages next the cross, are called _Heads_. I would recommend
that the gutters should be cut a little longer than the page, the
heads for each quarter being in two pieces, so that the gutter may be
between them; one head will thus project a little over the sidestick,
and will form an abutment for it, while the other will project a
little over the back; by this method there will be no danger of any
of them binding, and the gutters will answer for pages of different
lengths.

HANGS. _See_ LETTER HANGS.--_M._


HANG UP PAPER.

To hang the sheets upon the poles to dry after they have been printed.

For this purpose the warehouseman takes the peel in his hand, and
lays it flat upon the heap that is to be hung up, so as to let the
paper project beyond the left side of it; he turns over upon it from
six to twelve or fourteen sheets of paper, with the wrapper, and
then moves the peel two or three inches to the left, and goes on
repeating the process, till he has got as many lifts on it as it will
conveniently support; he then raises them above the pole on which
they are to be placed, and holding the handle slanting the sheets
open at the under side, so that when the peel is withdrawn the lifts
are left suspended on the pole; he then inserts the end of the peel
between the first and second lifts, which are undermost, where he
shifted his peel in taking them up, lifts them a little, and moves
them farther from each other on the pole, still letting the one
overhang a little the other he leaves in its first place, and thus he
proceeds till one by one he has separated all he had upon his peel;
he then takes another peelful, repeating this process, and so he goes
on till the whole heap is hung up.

He is guided by circumstances as to the number of sheets he should
take in a lift: if the work is in a great hurry, or his vacant poles
are not in a favourable situation for drying, or the weather be rainy
and the atmosphere charged with moisture, he will hang the paper up
thin; but if he is short of pole-room, and the work is not in a great
hurry, if the situation is favourable for drying, and the weather dry
and warm, he will make his lifts thicker; but I would caution him not
to go to an extreme, as in that case the paper may mildew upon the
poles, particularly in the fold.

Houses of extensive business have drying rooms fitted up with pipes,
and heated either with steam or hot water, so that they can dry their
printed paper expeditiously, without hinderance or drawback.


HANG THE PLATEN.

To tie the platen to the hose hooks, in a wooden press.

To perform this it is usual to lay on the press stone a form of solid
type, and to turn the tympans down upon it, to place the platen in
its place, square with the press, to pull the bar home, and to keep
it in this situation by a letter board placed so as to take a bearing
against the shoulder of the bar close to the handle, and also against
the off cheek; but I prefer a piece of wide furniture with a notch
cut in one end for the bar, and the other end against the off cheek,
as it is more secure and less liable to be displaced; then to make a
noose on a piece of laid cord, place this on one of the front hose
hooks, and take a turn round the corresponding platen hooks, and
continue these turns till a sufficient quantity of cord is wound
round the hooks; take a hitch round one of the hooks to prevent the
cord slipping, then begin to wind the cord round these layers, every
two or three turns drawing it tight by taking a turn round a short
piece of broad or narrow furniture, by means of which it may be drawn
more forcibly, so as to bring the parts together, which makes it so
firm that there is no danger of its giving way; the end may then be
fastened to one of the hooks. The same process is repeated at the
opposite angle, behind the press; then at the two other angles; the
platen is then firmly hung, and is ready for work.

The same process is observed in iron presses, with the exception that
the platen is not tied with cord; it is attached to the press by
means of screws.

When there is too much pull in working at press, particularly with
engravings, and the lines come off strong which ought to be light and
delicate, it is said the impression is hard.


HARD INK.

Ink very well boiled.--_M._ It is now called strong ink.


HARD JUSTIFYING.

If a compositor fills his stick very stiff with letters or spaces,
they say it is hard justified.--_M._


HARD PULL.

In justifying the head of a press for a short pull, which is done by
putting solid blocks of wood into the mortises of the cheeks, it is
called an _Hard Pull_.--_M._ This relates to wooden presses; but,
instead of the blocks of wood, scaleboard is now used, additional
pieces of which are put into the mortises, by lowering the head,
which is again tightly screwed up: in the Stanhope Press, and in
Clymer’s, it is accomplished by shortening the coupling bar, by
means of a screw; in Cogger’s press, by a screw through the head;
and in Cope’s press, by putting pieces of plate iron upon the crown
of the platen. In Sherwin and Cope’s Imperial press, by turning a
screw attached to a wedge placed in the front, above the spindle; Mr.
Hopkinson has adopted the same method in Cope’s press, placed on the
near side.


HARD WORK.

With compositors, ill written copy, much Italick, Latin or Greek, or
marginal notes, or few breaks, &c. is called _Bad_, _Heavy_, _Hard
Work_: with pressmen, small letter and a large form is called _Hard
Work_.--_M._ _See_ BAD WORK.

There has been an alteration in the mode of paying for work since
Moxon’s time, which is to the advantage of the workman: foreign
languages, Greek, and marginal notes are now extra charges; and the
Pressman has an additional price for his work, as the type decreases
in size and the size of the page increases. _See_ PRICES.


HEAD.

That part of a wooden press in which the nut of the spindle is fixed;
it has a tenon at each end which fit into long mortises in the
cheeks, not tightly, but sufficiently so to prevent lateral motion;
and it is suspended from the cap by two long iron bolts, which go
through the head and the cap, above which are iron washers and
screws by which to lower the head, or screw it up tighter. The head
is usually made of elm. The whole of the pressure in the process of
printing is between the head and the winter.


HEAD BAND.

A thin bar of iron that connects the two sides of the tympans at the
top: it is made thin, to allow it to run under the platen without
impediment. The half of the frisket joints are riveted to the head
band. _See_ FRISKET JOINTS.


HEAD BOLTS.

Two long bolts that pass through the head and the cap, in wooden
presses, with a screw at the upper end: the head of the press is
supported upon the heads of the bolts, and their screw ends pass
through the cap, upon which they are secured by washers and female
screws that can be tightened by the fingers; these screws are for the
purpose of screwing up the head, to justify the pull.


HEAD LINE.

The top line of a page in which is the running title and the folio,
but sometimes only a folio: the divisions and subdivisions of a work,
when they are set in lines, and chapters, are also called _Head
Lines_.


HEAD OF A PAGE.

The top or beginning of a page.--_M._


HEAD PAGE.

The first page of a work, and each page on which a new division of
the subject commences, such as parts and chapters, provided they
begin the page.


HEAD PIECES.

The same changes have taken place with regard to head pieces that I
have described under the article FAC; from the beautiful drawings
with which manuscripts and some of the first productions of the press
were illuminated, they gradually descended to engravings on wood,
which was the first step, then to cast metal ornaments, and then to
the types called flowers, which were displayed in every variety of
form that they were capable of, or that the ingenuity of the printer
could devise; these gave place to a piece of double brass rule, that
is now out of fashion; and head pieces at the present day are only
spoken of as things that once existed. _See_ FAC.


HEAD STICK.

Pieces of furniture put at the head of pages when a form is imposed,
to make the margin at the head of the page; they are called reglets,
if they exceed not an English thick.--_M._ _See_ BOLTS.


HEAP.

So many reams or quires as are set out by the warehouse-keeper for
the pressman to wet, is called a _Heap_; but then it is called a dry
heap, till the pressman have wet it, and then it is indeed called a
_Heap_.--_M._

When paper is given out for a work, and wetted, it is called a heap,
and retains that name till it is made up into books.

In gathering the printed sheets in the warehouse, all the sheets of
each signature are placed upon the gathering table, arranged in their
regular order, except it be a long number, and then about a bundle of
each; each signature in this situation is called a heap.


HEAP HOLDS OUT.

When it hath its full intended number of sheets.--_M._ At the present
time, when accidents and other causes have not reduced the surplus so
much as to prevent the warehouseman from delivering the proper number.


HEAVY WORK. _See_ BAD WORK and HARD WORK.


HEBREW.

The Chaldaic letters are derived from the ancient Hebrew or
Samaritan, which are the same, or nearly so, with the old Phenicien.
The prophet Ezra, is supposed to have exchanged the old Hebrew
characters, for the more beautiful and commodious Chaldee, which are
still in use.

Hebrew has no capitals; and therefore letters of the same shape, but
of a large body, are used at the beginning of chapters and other
parts of Hebrew work.

Particular attention should be paid to the letters in the column
“Similitude” in the Table of the Alphabet, which are liable to be
mistaken, one for the other, on account of their great resemblance
one to another.

The vowels properly so called are ten in number, viz.:

            _Long._
         Kamets                  בָ‎ _ā_
         Tseri                   בֵ‎ _ē_
   Great Chirek                 בִי‎ _ēī_
         Hholem or Cholem        וֹ‎ _ō_
         Shurek                  וּ‎ _ū_, or _ōō_

            _Short._
         Patach                  בַ‎ _ă_
         Segol                   בֶ‎ _ĕ_
  Little Chirek                  בִ‎ _ĭ_
  Kamets Catuph, or short   (בֳ‎)  בָ‎ _ŏ_
         Kybbutz                 בֻ‎ _ŭ_

Sheva (בְ‎) ‎is sounded like very short _e_. 1. At the beginning of
a word. 2. In the middle after a long vowel, or instead of a long
vowel. 3. After a companion, _i. e._ another (וְ‎). 4. Under dagesh,
also under dagesh understood.

‎(בְ‎) never follows (בְ‎) in the beginning of a word, or in the
middle after a perfect syllable; but the first is changed into ‎(בִ‎)
‎(בַ‎) or (בֶ‎) chiefly on account of a guttural and ר‎: very seldom
into (בֳ‎).

Dagesh, from the Chaldaic, _he punctured_, is a point in the body of
a letter, and is either _lene_ or _forte_.

Dagesh lene removes the aspiration from the six letters
‎בְּגַדכְּפַת‎, and strengthens their pronunciation in some degree.

Dagesh forte doubles the letters in which it occurs. Regularly it
follows a short vowel, and only a long one when accented.

Mappik is a point in הּ‎ final only, but vanishes on an increase of
the word.


ACCENTS.

Hebrew accents are either mere points, or lines, or circles.

Those which are mere points or dots, consist of one, or two, or three
such points, and are always placed above the middle of the accented
letter, thus

That consisting of

    One, called _rebia_, ב֗‎, i. e. _sitting over_.

    Two, called royal _zakeph katon_, ב֔‎, or, _the little
    elevator_, from its figure which is composed of upright points.

    Three, called royal _segolta_, ב֒‎, an inverted (∵).

The lines are either upright, inclined, or transverse.

The upright is either solitary or with points or dots.

The solitary is either

  between two words ב׀ב‎, termed _pesick_, or musical pause, and
  terminating a song.

  or under a word

    _Metheg_ בֽ‎, or _bridle_, an euphonic accent at the beginning
    of a word.

    Royal _silluk_, בֽ‎, _end_, which is placed before (׃‎)
    _soph-pasuk_, i. e. towards the end.

With points, namely

    two, above the letter, royal _zakeph gadhol_ ב֕‎, _the great
    elevator_, strains the sound.

    one, below the letter, royal _tebhir_, ב֛‎, _broken_ sound,
    from its figure and tone.

Inclined lines hang either above or below.

Above, towards the right

    Leader _pashta_, ב֙‎, _extension_, extends the voice or sound,
    and is placed above the last letter of the word. Subservient
    _kadma_, ב֨‎, _antecedent_, to the leader _geresh_; and is
    placed above the penult or antepenult letter.

Above, towards the left

    Leader _geresh_, ב֝‎, _expulsion_, is sung with an impelled
    voice.

    Gereshajim, ב֞‎, _two expellers_, from the figure being doubled.

Below, towards the right--Leader _tiphcha_, ב֖‎, fatigue, from the
song, or note.

Below, towards the left

    Of subservient _Merca_, ב֥‎, _lengthening out_, from its
    lengthening out the song or note.

    _Merca kephula_, ב֦‎, _a double lengthening_ out from its music
    and figure.

The transverse line is either right or curved, thus: ‏֮־  ‎.

The right line is placed between two words, connecting them together,
thus, ב־ב‎, and is called _maccaph_, i. e. connexion.

The curved, or waved line, ב֮‎, is called leader, _zarka_, or, _the
disperser_, from its modulation and figure.

Circles are either entire or semi.

The entire circle is placed always above, and has a small inclined
line attached to it.

Either, on the left, when it is placed at the head of the word, ב֠‎,
and is called leader _telisha the greater_, or, _the great evulsion_.

Or, on the right, when it is placed at the end, ב֩‎, and is called
subservient _telisha the less_.

On both together, ב֟‎, called leader _karne para_, _the horns of the
heifer_, from its modulation and figure.

The semicircle is either _solitary_ or _pointed_.

The solitary is either _angular_ or _reflected_.

The angular is on the right

    Subservient _hillui_, ב֬‎, _elevated_, from the elevation of
    the voice.

    _Munach_, ב֣‎, _placed below_, from its position.

The angular is on the left

    Leader _jethith_, ב֚‎, drawing back, from its figure.

    Subservient _mahpach_, ב֤‎, _inverted_, also from its figure.

The reflected is

    either single subservient _darga_, ב֧‎, a degree.

    or double, leader, _shalsheleth_, ב֓‎, _a chain_, from its
    figure and modulation.

When joined with other points, it is either above or below the letter.

When above the letter it has a small line attached to it on the left,
‎ב֡‎, leader _paser_, _the dispersor_, from the diffusion of the note.

When below the letter, it is pointed either downwards, ב֑‎, called
royal _athnach_, _respiration_, as the voice must rest on it, and
respire; or upwards, ב֪‎, subservient, _jerah-ben-jomo_, _the moon of
its own day_, from its figure.--_Bythner’s Lyre of David, translated
by the Rev. Thomas Dee, A.B._ 8vo. Dublin, 1836.

The following observations are from Buxtorf’s Hebrew Grammar:

The finals are commonly called _Camnephatz_. But they are excepted
in four places, namely, Isaiah ix. 6. where the final Mem is in the
middle of a word; Nehemiah ii. 13. where the open Mem is at the end;
and Job xxxviii. 1. and xl. 6. where נ‎ is at the end.

These seven letters ﬡ‎ ﬢ‎ ﬣ‎ ﬥ‎ ﬦ‎ ﬧ‎ ﬨ‎ are sometimes lengthened,
either for the sake of elegance, or for filling out the line, which
is never to be finished with a divided word.

The units are compounded with the tens and hundreds, as יא‎ 11, קא‎
101, and so on: but for יה‎ 15 is סו‎ 9 and 6, lest the sacred name
‎יָה‎ _Jah_ should be profaned.--_Buxtorf._

Hebrew is read from the right to the left. In composing it, the
general method is to place the nick of the letter downwards, and when
the points are put to the top, to turn the line and arrange those
points that come under the letter, taking care to place them in the
following order; if the letter has but one leg, the point must be
placed immediately under that leg, but otherwise the point must be
placed under the centre.

Smith, in his Printer’s Grammar, has the following observations
on Hebrew; I have not been able to ascertain upon what authority
his reasoning is founded, but I have ascertained the fact of the
variation in the types, that he speaks of, by an examination of a
Hebrew Bible.

“But we must not pronounce it a fault, if we happen to meet in some
Bibles with words that begin with a letter of a much larger Body than
the mean Text; nor need we be astonish’d to see words with letters in
them of a much less Body than the mean Text; or wonder to see final
letters used in the middle of words; for such Notes shew that they
contain some particular and mystical meaning. Thus in 2 Chron. I. 1.
the word _Adam_ begins with a letter of a larger size than the rest,
thereby to intimate, that Adam is the father of all Mankind. Again,
in Genes. I. 1. the great Beth in the word _Bereschith_ stands for a
Monitor of the great and incomprehensible work of Creation. Contrary
to the first, in Prov. XXVIII. 17. the Daleth in the word _Adam_ is
considerably less than the Letter of the main text, to signify, that
whoever oppresses another openly or clandestinely, tho’ of a mean
condition; or who sheds innocent blood, is not worthy to be called
Man.

“Sometimes the open or common Mem stands in the room of a final one;
as in Nehem. II. 13. where the word _hem_ has an open Mem at the
end, in allusion to the torn and open walls of Jerusalem, of which
there is mention made; and in Es. VII. 14. where the Prophet speaks
of the Conception of the Virgin Mary, the Mem in the word _haalma_,
or Virgin, is a close or final letter, to intimate the virginity of
the mother of our Saviour. Such are the peculiarities of some Jewish
Rabbis in Bibles of their publication; of which we have instanced the
above, to caution compositors not to take them for faults, if such
mystical writings should come under their hands.”--_Smith._

The following is the date to an Hebrew and Spanish folio Bible,
printed by Proops of Amsterdam in 5522 (_i. e._ 1762), showing
the date as usual in a sentence, the letters by which the date is
computed being larger.

_Rabbinical._--The language or dialect of the Rabbins is divided into
two branches; one approaching nearer to the Hebrew, and the other to
the Chaldee, yet each agrees with the other in many points, and both
are generally used in conjunction in writing.

The letters agree with the Hebrew and Chaldee in regard to their
number and power, but they differ as to the form; for although in the
Talmudic text of the Holy Scriptures the Hebrew square character is
used, yet in commentaries and elsewhere a rounder letter is adopted,
better suited to promote facility in writing. Their points of
agreement or difference are shown in the subjoined table:--

  ‎א‎ א‎  Aleph.
  ‎ב‎ ב‎  Beth.
  ‎ג‎ ג‎  Gimel.
  ‎ד‎ ד‎  Daleth.
  ‎ה‎ ה‎  He.
  ‎ו‎ ו‎  Vau.
  ‎ז‎ ז‎  Zain.
  ‎ח‎ ח‎  Cheth.
  ‎ט‎ ט‎  Teth.
  ‎י‎ י‎  Jod.
  ‎כ‎ כ‎  Caph.
  ‎ל‎ ל‎  Lamed.
  ‎מ‎ מ‎  Mem.

  ‎צ‎ צ‎  Tzaddi.
  ‎ק‎ ק‎  Koph.
  ‎ר‎ ר‎  Resch.
  ‎ש‎ ש‎  Schin.
  ‎ת‎ ת‎  Tau.

The finals are the same as in Hebrew, the forms of which they also
imitate, in this manner, ך ך‎, ם ם‎, ן ן‎, ף ף‎, ץ ץ‎.

There are no lengthened letters in printed books.

The two letters א‎ and ל‎ are often connected by the Rabbins in this
manner, ﭏ; as, הﭏ for הָאֵל‎ _Deus_, ﭏא for אֶלָּא‎ _sed_.

It is also to be remarked that they write the name of GOD in
different ways; namely, the Tetragrammaton, or יְיָ‎ with the
Targumists, or יי‎, or האם‎ and abbreviated ה׳‎, _nomen illud_, i.e.
the most excellent; but in expressing the word אלהים‎, they change
the letter ‎ה‎ into ד‎ or ק‎, thus, אלדים‎ or אלקים‎, which agrees
with a general superstition of the Jews.

The vowel points are the same as in the Hebrew, but they are rarely
expressed, except in books written for the use of students. When
they are wanting, they must be gathered from analogy, in which much
assistance may be gained from the frequent use and study of the
Hebrew; but where conjecture may be difficult, the three letters
‎י‎ ו‎ א‎, which are called _the mothers of reading_, are used in
order to assist the reader. Thus ‎(1.) א‎ denotes Kamets in גנשי‎
_turpitudo_, וודאי‎ _confessum_, פדאם‎ _redemit eos_, &c; (2.) Vau
denotes Cholem, Kybbutz, and Kamets-catuph; as, לקרוא‎ _vocare_,
‎פוקד‎ _visitans_; כולם‎ for כֻלָּם‎ _omnes illi_, ‎כהוכה‎ for
‎כְהֻכָּה‎ _sacerdotium_, לפותרו‎ for לְפָתְּרוֹ‎ _ad explicandum
illud_, &c; (3.) Jod denotes Chirek, Tseri, Segol, and occasionally
in the Talmud both simple and compound Sheva; as, תפילה‎ _precatio_,
‎בישר‎ _annunciavit_, איבר‎ _perdidit_; also פירוש‎ for פֵרוּש‎
_explicatio_, ‎אילי‎ for אֵלַי‎ _ad me_, שיני‎ for שֵׁנִי‎
_secundus_, ביה‎ for בֵּהּ‎ _in eo_, בריה‎ for בְרֵהּ‎ _filius ejus_,
and so continually to mark the feminine affix בְּרָהּ‎.

The rules for the vowels, and for the Sheva, both simple and
compound, and also for the diphthongs, are the same as in the Hebrew
and Chaldee.

‎א‎ is often absorbed by crasis, as, מצינא‎ for מָצֵי אֲנָא‎
_possum_, as if it were _potens ego_, ידענא‎ _scio_, also of the
feminine by an enallage frequent in this contraction, thus in לית‎
and ליכא‎ for לא אית‎ and ‎לא אינא‎ _non est_. In the same manner
‎ה‎ is omitted by the Jews in ‎תילם‎ for תהילים‎ _psalmi_. But many
others are accustomed to be contracted in this manner by the Jews of
Jerusalem, viz., א‎ in נילו‎ for ‎כאילו‎ _quasi_, ות‎ for ואת‎ _et
tu_, דת‎ for דאת‎ _quod tu_, דנא‎ for ‎דאנא‎ _quod ego_, ‎והיידינו‎
for והיידא דין הוא‎ _quodnam est illud_; ה‎ in לון‎ for ‎להון‎
_illis_; ח‎ in ‎תותי‎ for תחותי‎ _sub_; ד‎ in קם‎, קום‎, or קותי‎,
for ‎קודם‎ _ante_.

Apocope is frequent among the Talmudists, as, בי‎ for בית‎ _domus_,
or ‎בין‎ _inter_. So in the pronouns both separate and suffixed, אתו‎
for ‎אתון‎ _vos_, נו‎ for נון‎ _vos_, _vester_, הי‎ for הון‎ _illis_,
_suis_; also in the feminine, ‎ני‎ for נין‎, הי‎ for הין‎; and in the
verbs, as, ‎גרסי‎ for גרסית‎ _docui_, ‎שקלתו‎ _sustulistis_, קאיו‎
_stans_, &c.

Aphæresis also occurs, though seldom, in חד‎ for אחד‎ _unus_, נא‎ for
‎אנא‎ _ego_, נן‎ for אנן‎ _nos_, מר‎ for אמר‎ _dixit_.

They leave the Dagesh, both lene and forte, to be collected from
analogy, but where it may be difficult to guess at, as in the
preterite Pihel, the letter י‎ indicates the little Chirek as well as
the Dagesh forte, as, כיסה‎ for כִסָּה‎ _texit_; and in defectives
the letter which had been thrown aside is sometimes restored, as,
‎ינקם‎ for יִקֹם‎ _ulciscetur_, from נקם‎ _ulcisci_.

A point at the end of a letter generally denotes a number, as, א׳‎
_unum_, ב׳‎ _duo_, ג׳‎ _tria_, &c; but at the end of two or more
letters it signifies a word cut off by a certain abbreviation, as,
‎את׳‎ for _dixit_, ‎לות׳‎ for לותר‎ _dicere_, ה׳ ית׳‎ for הַשֵׁם
‎יִתְבָרֵךְ‎ _Deus benedictus_, וגו׳‎ for ‎וִגוֹמַר‎ _et cætera_, in
an abrupt passage of Scripture, וכו׳‎ for וְכֻלּוֹ‎ _et totum illud_,
in sacred or profane use. Also פי׳‎ for פֵרוּשׁ‎ _interpretatio_, or
‎פֵרֵשׁ‎ _interpretatus est_, ר׳‎ for רבי‎ _Rabbi_, _Magister_, שנ׳‎
for ‎שֶׁנִּאֱמַר‎ _quia dictum est_, &c.

A double point affixed to a letter indicates either compound numbers,
as, י״ד‎ 14, ט״ו‎ 15, תמ״ד‎ 444; or letters taken materially,
as, א״לף‎ _Aleph_, ב״ית‎ _Beth_, גי״מל‎ _Gimel_, &c.; or lastly
abbreviations by initial letters alone, denoting entire words,
which is called ‎ראשי תיבות‎; the number of these is very great,
as אי״ה‎, that is, ‮(יעזור‎) ‎אם ירצה השם‎‬ _si voluerit_ (or
_juverit_) _Deus_, א״כ‎ אִם כֵן‎ _si sic_, _si verum est_, ‎אע״פיש‎
for אַף עַל פִי שֶׁ אף על פי ש‎ _etsi_, _quanquam_, ה״בה‎ or הק״בה‎
for הברוך הוא‎ or הקדוש ברוך הוא‎ _Deus benedictus_, _Deus sanctus
benedictus_; ‎ה״שו‎ for השם ימברך‎ _Deus benedictus_, ז״ל‎ for
‎זכרונו לברכה‎ _memoria ejus sit in benedictione_, or in the plural
number זכרונם לברכה‎ _memoria eorum sit in benedictione_; מ״ו‎ for
‎מס ושלום‎ _parce et pax sit_, that is, _absit_; ״א‎ for יש אמרים‎
_sunt qui dicunt_; ״מ‎ for מפרשים יש‎ _sunt qui interpretentur_;
‎י״ל‎ for יַשׁ לוֹמַר‎ _est dicere_, _respondendum est_; יצר׳‎ for
‎ישמרהו צורו וגואלו‎ _custodiat eum petra ejus, et redemptor ejus_;
‎כ״א‎ for ‎כִּי אִם‎ _sed_, _nisi_; כ״כ‎ for כָל־כַךְ‎ _tantopere_;
‎נ״פ‎ for כָל־פָנִים‎ _omnibus modis_; כ״ש‎ for כָל־שֶׁכֵּן‎ _quantò
magis_, _quantò minus_; ל״ש‎ for לְשֵׁם שָׁמַֽיִם‎ _in honorem Dei_;
‎מ״מ‎ for מִכָּל־מָקוֹם‎ _nihilominus_, _tamen_; ע״ד‎ for ‎עַל דֶרֶךְ‎
_more_, _in modum_; ע״ה‎ for השלום‎ _super quo pax_, ע״ז‎ for ‎עבודה
‎זרה‎ _cultus alienus_, _idololatria_; ע״פ‎ for על פי‎ _ad formam_,
_modum_; ‎ע״צ‎ for עַל צַד‎ _ad latus_, _juxta_; פ״א‎ for פירוש אקר‎
_expositio alia_; ר״ל‎ for רוצה לומר‎ _vult dicere_. Also ר״אבע‎
_Rabbi Aben-Ezra_, ר״דק‎ _Rabbi David Kimchi_, רל״בג‎ _Rabbi Levi
Ben Gerson_, רמ״בם‎ _Rabbi Moses Ben Maiemon_, ר״שי‎ _Rabbi Salomon
Iarchi_, or _Isaac_, &c., which are also read abbreviated, and, as it
were, figuratively, _Raba_, _Radak_, _Ralbag_, _Rambam_, _Raschi_, &c.

Accents are omitted in Rabbinical books; but in pronouncing words
the Hebrew accent is transposed from the last syllable to the
penultimate, thus, they read בראשית ברא אלהים‎ _Beréschith bóro
Elóhim_, ‎עולם הבא‎ _aúlom hábbo_; for Vau Cholem is generally
pronounced as the diphthong _au_, and the vowel Kamets as an _o_.

There are also certain marks of distinction, by which the perfect
sense of a sentence is shown; for an imperfect sentence is not
pointed off, and often not even a perfect one. But for this purpose
there is used, either two perpendicular points, like the Soph-pasuk
in Hebrew, but which appears rarely, and indeed not at all in some
books; or a single point at the top of the letter similar to the
Greek colon; or lastly, a down stroke, either straight, or oblique
like the Greek acute accent, which, although the most frequently
used, is yet often neglected.

The purer Rabbins commonly use Hebrew words, but they have also
some words peculiar to themselves, which are either borrowed from
other languages, as, for example, from the Chaldee, אִילָן‎ _arbor_,
‎גַדָּא‎ _fortuna_, חָזַר‎ _rediit_, &c.; from the Greek, אויר‎,
ἀὴρ, _aër_, זימן‎, σημεῖον, _signum_, דורון‎, δῶρον, _donum_,
‎הדיוע‎, ἰδώτης, _idiota_, פרהסייא‎, παῤῥησία, בפרהסייא‎ _apertè_,
_palàm_, &c.; from the Latin, אושפיזא‎ _hospes_ and _hospitium_,
‎פלעיו‎ and פלעוריו‎ _palatium_, &c.; and even from the Hebrew, but
in a Syro-Chaldaic signification, as, פרע‎ _rependit_, _ultus est_,
‎שקל‎ _sustulit_, פרח‎ _volavit_, סמר‎ _destruxit_, &c., or taken
evidently in a new sense, as, חין‎ _hæreticus_, טען‎ _argumentando
objecit_. Also these three, שמים‎ _cœlum_, המקום‎ _locus_, and גבורה‎
_fortitudo_, are often put for _Deus_, God.

‎קָ‎, from the full particle קָא‎, prefixed to words expletively, and
without any increase of signification, seems to be numbered with the
serviles by the Talmudists, and which the more vulgar Rabbins, as
Rabbi Lipman and the like, who are careless of a correct style, also
imitate, as, דקאמר‎ _qui dixit_, מאי קעביד משה‎ _quid fecit Moses?_
‎לא הווקא מעייליו ליה‎ _non introduxerunt eum_, &c.

The preceding observations are translated from a small treatise

In the above plans the Hebrew Cases nearly resemble those of the
English now in use. The alphabets have been classified and arranged
so as to facilitate the composing of it; that is, the three different
dotted alphabets in the upper case are quite distinct from each
other, being separated by a thicker partition, to lead the eye of the
compositor to it with greater certainty. The alphabet, with the dot
over the letter, appears first in order, or left hand side of the
case; the second alphabet, with the dot in the middle of the letter,
under that of the first; and the third alphabet, with the dot over
and in the middle of the letter, in the small capital, or right hand
side of the case; and underneath, the points and accents required in
composing Hebrew with points.

The lower case letters are also arranged as near to the English plan
as is possible: the א‎ (a) in the a box; the ב‎ (b) in the b box, &c.
so that the compositor can go from a pair of English cases to the
Hebrew ones with very little perplexity, and a great saving of time,
instead of looking over a wide surface of three cases, as is now the
case, without any classification or arrangement whatever.

In composing Hebrew without points the lower case only is required,
as the final letters and broad letters are brought into it, and quite
under the hand of the compositor, which is desirable.

The two first being ordinarily represented by gold and silver, are
called metals, and named by heralds after the French.

The two last are rarely seen in English coats of arms. The heraldic
colours are usually estimated as five,--red, blue, black, green,
purple.


HIGH BEARER. _See_ BEARER.


HIND POSTS AND RAILS.

Two upright posts mortised and tenoned into the feet at the back
of the wooden press; two rails connect these posts behind; and two
rails on the off side and two on the near side connect them with the
cheeks, by mortises and tenons; on the top rails a thin deal covering
is laid loose, that it may be lifted off, to allow access to the long
ribs, and to hang the platen when necessary; it prevents dirt and
other matter from falling on the ribs, and serves for a temporary
shelf. The ink block is attached to the near rails.


HITHER CHEEK. Same as NEAR CHEEK, which _see_.


HOLDFASTS, for Stereotype Risers. _See_ RISERS.


HOLDS OUT, or HOLDS NOT OUT.

These terms are applicable to the quires of white paper, to
wrought-off heaps, to gathered books, and to sorts of letter, &c. If
quires of white paper have twenty-five sheets apiece in them, they
say, the paper holds out five and twenties. Of wrought-off heaps, the
heap that comes off first in gathering is said not to hold out. Of
gathered books, if the intended number of perfect books are gathered,
they say the impression holds out: but if the intended number
of perfect books cannot be gathered off the heaps, they say the
impression holds not out. And so for sorts of letter, either when it
is in the founding house, or in the printing house.--_M._ There is no
paper at the present day with twenty-five sheets in a quire, except
that used for newspapers, on account of the stamps.


HOLE.

By a Hole, in printers dialect, is meant and understood a place where
private printing is used, viz. the printing of unlicensed books,
or printing of other men’s copies. Many printers for lucre of gain
have gone into Holes, and then their chief care is to get a Hole
private, and workmen trusty and cunning to conceal the Hole, and
themselves.--_M._


HOLY-DAYS. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.


HOME.

This is a term used at Press, and means that the bar of the press is
pulled over till it touches the near cheek; it is then said the bar
is home, or it is cheeked. _See_ CHEEK THE BAR.


HOOK-IN.

In poetry it occasionally happens that a line will not come into the
measure, in which case, when it is not allowed to turn a line, if
it be possible to avoid it, a syllable, or a word, is taken to the
end of the preceding line, or, if that be full, to the end of the
following one, and enclosed in a bracket; this is termed _Hooking-in_.

HORSE.

Form or bench pressmen set the heaps of paper on. _See also_ ANCIENT
CUSTOMS.--_M._ In Moxon’s time it appears the pressmen used what was
then called a _Horse_, only, for the paper when working, which we now
call a _Bank_; we have in addition what is termed a horse, set upon
the bank; this horse is made sloping down to the fore edge, and the
white paper is placed on it; the pressman is thus enabled to draw the
sheets down with the nail of his thumb, or a piece of wood, bone, or
ivory, with more facility than if it were laid horizontal, and it is
more convenient to remove to the tympan, as the horse is raised near
to it, and inclines in the same direction.


HORSE FLESH.

If any journeyman set down in his bill on Saturday night more work
than he has done, that surplusage is called _Horse-flesh_; and he
abates it in his next bill.--_M._ This surplusage of charge, as Moxon
terms it, is now called _Horse_, and it is not always deducted in the
next bill.


HORSE RACES.

By the Act of the 13th of George 2. cap. 19.

  s. 2. it is enacted, “That from and after the said twenty-fourth
  Day of _June_ one thousand seven hundred and forty, no Plate,
  Prize, Sum of Money, or other Thing, shall be run for by any
  Horse, Mare or Gelding, or advertised, published or proclaimed
  to be run for by any Horse, Mare or Gelding, unless such Plate,
  Prize or Sum of Money shall be of the full, real and intrinsick
  Value of fifty Pounds, or upwards; and in case any Person or
  Persons shall from and after the twenty-fourth Day of _June_ one
  thousand seven hundred and forty enter, start or run any Horse,
  Mare or Gelding, for any Plate, Prize, Sum of Money, or other
  Thing of less Value than fifty Pounds, or shall make, print,
  advertise, publish or proclaim any Advertisement or Notice of
  any Plate, Prize, Sum of Money, or other Thing of less Value
  than fifty Pounds as aforesaid, to be run for by any Horse, Mare
  or Gelding; every such Person or Persons so entering, starting
  or running such Horse, Mare or Gelding for such Plate, Prize,
  Sum of Money, or other Thing of less Value than fifty Pounds as
  aforesaid, shall forfeit and lose the Sum of two hundred Pounds,
  to be sued for, recovered and disposed of in such Manner as
  is herein after prescribed and directed; and every Person or
  Persons who shall make, print, publish, advertise or proclaim any
  Advertisement or Notice of any Plate, Prize, Sum of Money, or
  other Thing of less Value than fifty Pounds aforesaid, to be run
  for by any Horse, Mare or Gelding, shall forfeit and lose the Sum
  of one hundred Pounds.”

So much of the act of 13 Geo. 2. c. 19. “as relates to the Subject of
Horse Racing,” was repealed by 3 Vict. c. 5. s. 1.


HOSE.

Two upright bars of iron that connected the garter and the hose
hooks, and went through the till. There were screws at each end, by
which they could tighten the platen cords, if they became slack.--_M._

The hose in wooden presses is now quite different: it is a wooden
case for the spindle to work in, made hollow in the inside to fit
it, and to which it is connected by the garter; it is square on the
outside, and passes through an opening in the till, which it should
fit accurately; and is tied to the platen by means of four iron
hooks, one at each bottom corner. Its uses are, to guide the platen
down to the form in a horizontal position, by its passing through the
till; and also to lift the platen from off the form, which it does
by the return of the press bar, and its connexion with the spindle by
means of the garter.


HOSE HOOKS.

Four iron hooks at the bottom corners of the hose, to which the
platen is tied. They are projections from an iron belt that embraces
the bottom of the hose, and stand facing the platen hooks.


HOURS.

Pressmen reckon their works by hours, accounting every token to an
hours work: and though it be the same effectually with tokens, yet
they make their prices of different work by the hour; and it passes
current for a token. If two men work at the press, ten quires is an
hour; if one man, five quires is an hour.--_M._ The quires of paper
at this time always contain twenty-four sheets, at least the inside
quires do, which alone are used for bookwork; and a token is ten
quires eighteen sheets, which is still called an Hour, whatever the
price may be: thus, if two men at a press print twelve tokens of
paper in a day, they say, they have done twelve hours; and if it be
fine work, at which, through the care bestowed on it, they can only
print three tokens, or four tokens, they say, they do three hours, or
four hours, in a day; although it takes the same time in performing
that the twelve tokens did.


HYDRAULIC PRESS.

This press was invented and introduced to the public by Mr. Joseph
Bramah, of Piccadilly, Engineer. Mr. W. Nicholson, in his Journal of
Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts, vol. 1. April, 1797,
gave an account of it, with engravings, from which the following
observations are extracted, which will give a brief description of
this powerful machine, that is superseding the common book press with
a screw in all extensive establishments.

“Its action is as follows: when the lever or pump handle is raised,
it brings up the piston, which would leave a vacuum beneath if the
pressure of the atmosphere did not force the water in through a
side valve. The lever is then to be pressed down, which causes the
side valve to shut, and forces the water through a valve at the
bottom, whence it passes through a pipe into the cavity of the great
cylinder, and raises the piston or pressing rammer. A repetition of
the same process forces more water in, and the pressure may in this
manner be carried to a great extent.

“There is no difficulty in computing the force of this instrument.
If the diameter of the pump barrel be one quarter of an inch, and
that of the cylinder one inch, that is to say, four quarters of an
inch; one pound lodged upon the piston rod of the pump will be in
equilibrio with sixteen pounds lodged upon the table of the press;
the weights of the parts of the engine attached to, and moving with
each piston, being respectively included. And if the length of the
pump lever be fifteen inches, and the distance between the centres
of motion and of action be two inches, one pound at the end of the
lever will gain an advantage of 7½ times when compared with that at
the piston rod. Instead, therefore, of sixteen pounds upon the table
being equal in effect to counterpoise this last action, there will be
required upwards of 120 pounds. But a man in this action of pumping
by a downward pressure, can without difficulty apply his whole
weight, and with great ease one third or one fourth of his weight,
suppose 50 pounds. In this case the pressure will be equivalent to
fifty times 120 pounds, or 6000 pounds, that is to say, nearly three
tons.

“To compare this engine with a screw, in theory, we must enquire what
fineness of thread and length of lever would afford a purchase of
120 to one. Let us suppose the thread of a screw, substituted in the
place of the cylinder, to be one tenth of an inch thick; the distance
from the top of one thread to the top of the next will in this case
be one fifth of an inch. This is the space through which the weight
must rise in one revolution. The power must therefore move through
120 times that space, namely twenty-five inches; but a lever or
radius four inches long will describe a circle somewhat larger than
this, and consequently such an engine would in theory be equal in
power to the hydraulic engine we have been contemplating.

“But when the subject is viewed practically, the difference between
the two engines appears to be very remarkable. All practical men
know how very large a part of the force operating by means of
engines is employed in overcoming frictions. Every one is aware of
the extreme friction between solids, and the very slight friction
which takes place between the parts of fluids. This is seen in the
common expedient of oiling the pivots of wheels, and in the very
gradual decay of motion in fluid bodies; while solids moving on each
other stop at once, as soon as the force is diminished to a certain
degree. The screw is an organ peculiarly liable to friction, and this
friction is always much greater than the whole of the reacting force;
for there are few instances where a screw will return from extreme
pressure, when the agency upon the lever is withdrawn. It is also to
be considered, that the whole force of the weight or resistance acts
directly upon the face of the screw, at which the motion is required
to take place. It has not been appreciated in what degree this
resistance or friction increases with the weight. In lighter actions
the simple ratio has been inferred; but under more severe pressures
the two metallic faces extrude the greater part of the half-fluid
matter between them, and appear, by the magnitude of their
resistance, to be attached to each other by a process of the nature
of cohesive attraction. For these and other reasons, it appears
nearly impracticable to form any comparison between two engines so
different in principle, but such as shall be deduced from immediate
experiment of their effects. I am not in possession of numerical data
to indicate the actual power of screw-engines or presses; which are
perhaps the less necessary, because those who are the most interested
in the success of an improvement like the present, are for the most
part able to come at these without difficulty.

“In an engine of this kind, the diameter of the great piston was
four inches, and of the smaller three-eighths of an inch; and the
advantage given by the lever or handle was twelve to one. Above the
piston of the great cylinder was applied a long lever, at one end
of which was an axis, and at the other end a large scale to hold
weights; it contained twenty hundred weight. The distance between
the axis of motion of this lever and the part where it acted on the
piston was six inches; and the distance from the same axis to the
extremity where the scale was hung was 126 inches. Every hundred
weight in the scale consequently pressed upon the piston with a
force equal to twenty-one hundred weight; whence the whole pressure
was twenty-one tons. It was easy to work the lever briskly with one
hand, and each stroke raised the scale near one-third of an inch.
Forty-seven pounds hung at the end of the lever, carried it down with
a moderate swiftness of working; but a weight of only forty-three
pounds remained in equilibrio, and did not descend. Now, as the true
weight in theory was thirty-two pounds, it follows that less than
one-third of the actual power was employed to give velocity and
overcome all friction.

“It may be remarked, that the principal frictions in these machines
must be at the circumference of the pistons, and that these do not
increase in the simple, but in less than the subduplicate, ratio of
the power. For if the diameter of the great cylinder were double,
every thing else remaining unchanged, the surface of its piston, and
consequently the power, would be quadrupled. But the friction would
be only doubled, and that merely at the leathering of the greater
piston.

“As the pressure in the experiment last mentioned amounted to 47·040
pounds upon the great piston of four inches in diameter, or sixteen
circular inches surface, it amounted to 2940 pounds upon each
round inch. But the medium pressure of the atmosphere on a round
inch is near twelve pounds, consequently the action was equal to
245 atmospheres: and as each of these corresponds with a column of
34 feet of fresh water at a medium, the water in the cylinder was
pressed in the same manner as if the whole column had been 8330 feet,
or 1⅔ mile, long.

“Large presses of this construction are made with two pumps of 1¼
inch bore, and a cylinder of seven inches. These have been used in
pressing hay and cotton for package; and, as I am informed, are
effective in producing a greater condensation on the material with a
much less application of moving power and consumption of time.”

The following description and figures are taken from Dr. Ure’s
Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures and Mines, 8vo. 1839.

[Illustration: _Fig._ 1. _Fig._ 2.]

“The framing consists of two stout cast-iron plates _a_, _b_, which
are strengthened by projecting ribs, not seen in the section, _fig._
1. The top or crown plate _b_, and the base plate _a_, are bound most
firmly together by four cylinders of the best wrought iron, _c_,
_c_, which pass up through holes near the ends of the said plates,
and are fast wedged in them. The flat pieces _e_, _e_, are screwed
to the ends of the crown and base plates, so as to bind the columns
laterally. _f_ is the hollow cylinder of the press, which, as well as
the ram _g_, is made of cast iron. The upper part of the cavity of
the cylinder is cast narrow, but is truly and smoothly rounded at the
boring-mill, so as to fit pretty closely round a well-turned ram or
piston; the under part of it is left somewhat wider in the casting. A
stout cup of leather, perforated in the middle, is put upon the ram,
and serves as a valve to render the neck of the cylinder perfectly
water-tight, by filling up the space between it and the ram; and
since the mouth of the cup is turned downwards, the greater the
pressure of water upwards, the more forcibly are the edges of the
leather valve pressed against the inside of the cylinder, and the
tighter does the joint become. This was Bramah’s beautiful invention.

“Upon the top of the ram, the press-plate or table _h_, strengthened
with projecting ridges, rests, which is commonly called the follower,
because it follows the ram closely in its descent. This plate has
a half-round hole at each of its four corners, corresponding to
the shape of the four iron columns along which it glides in its
up-and-down motions of compression and relaxation.

[Illustration: _Fig._ 3. _Fig._ 4.]

“_k_, _k_, _figs._ 1. and 2., is the framing of a force pump with
a narrow barrel; _i_ is the well for containing water to supply
the pump. To spare room in the engraving, the pump is set close
to the press, but it may be removed to any convenient distance by
lengthening the water-pipe _u_, which connects the discharge of the
force pump with the inside of the cylinder of the press. _Fig._ 3.
is a section of the pump and its valves. The pump _m_, is of bronze;
the suction-pipe _n_, has a conical valve with a long tail; the
solid piston or plunger _p_, is smaller than the barrel in which it
plays, and passes at its top through a stuffing-box _q_; _r_ is the
pressure-valve, _s_ is the safety-valve, which, in _fig._ 2., is
seen to be loaded with a weighted lever; _t_ is the discharge-valve,
for letting the water escape, from the cylinder beneath the ram,
back into the well. See the winding passages in _fig._ 4. _u_ is the
tube which conveys the water from the pump into the press-cylinder.
In _fig._ 2. two centres of motion for the pump-lever are shown.
By shifting the bolt into the centre nearest the pump-rod, the
mechanical advantage of the workman may be doubled. Two pumps are
generally mounted in one frame for one hydraulic press; the larger to
give a rapid motion to the ram at the beginning, when the resistance
is small; the smaller to give a slower but more powerful impulsion,
when the resistance is much increased. A pressure of 500 tons may be
obtained from a well-made hydraulic press with a ten-inch ram, and a
two and a one inch set of pumps.”

In a Report addressed to the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Woods,
Forests, &c., in July 1839, as the result of an inquiry with
reference to the selection of stone for building the new Houses of
Parliament, it is stated the experiments relating to the cohesive
strength of the stones, or their resistance to pressure, were made
at the manufactory of Messrs. Bramah and Robinson, with a six-inch
hydraulic press, the pump of which was one inch in diameter.
According to trials previously made by Messrs. Bramah and Robinson,
one pound weight at the end of the pump lever produced a pressure on
the face of the cube [two inches square] equal to 2·53 cwt., or to
71·06 lbs. on the square inch; from this datum it may be estimated
how immense the pressure is that can be obtained by this press, when
the strength of a man is exerted at the pump. I have used the common
book press with an iron screw to press printed paper, and I have also
used a Hydraulic press of an estimated power of eighty tons: besides
the greater expedition in pumping this press up than screwing the
other down, I can state from my own observation, that the hydraulic
press produced as great an effect upon the paper in three hours as
the screw press did in a night, or at least fourteen hours. This may
show the great superiority of this press over that which has been
in general use in printing offices. The hydraulic press has fully
accomplished in practice all that was expected from it, and has
established for itself a high character, which it richly deserves.


HYPHEN.

A hyphen, marked thus (-), is employed in connecting compounded
words; as, “Lap-dog, tea-pot, pre-existence, self-love, to-morrow,
mother-in-law.”

It is also used when a word is divided, and the former part is
written or printed at the end of one line, and the latter part at the
beginning of another. In this case, it is placed at the end of the
first line, not at the beginning of the second.--_Murray._

IDENTIGRAPHY.

The Dutch papers in 1825 mentioned a new discovery in printing, to
which the inventor gave the name of Identigraphy. It consists in a
new application of the art of lithography, by which a reprint of
common letterpress is obtained in a very short time; the inventor
undertaking to reprint the foreign journals within two hours after
their arrival by the mail.

IMPERFECTIONS.

_Books._--In gathering books, when one sheet is off, the surplus of
the other sheets is called Imperfections.--_M._

We now call this surplus the _Waste_: and after the work is
delivered, or is in a state of delivery, and the bookbinder, or any
person in whose possession the book may be, discovers that a sheet,
or part of a sheet, or a plate, or any part whatever, is wanting,
to make the book complete, he applies for them; or he may apply to
change a sheet that is either dirty or torn. These deficiencies, or
defects, are now termed Imperfections. _See_ WASTE.

_Letters._--When the founder has not cast a proportionable number of
each sort of letter, the wanting letters are called _Imperfections_,
as making the rest of the fount imperfect. _See_ SORTS.--_M._


IMPERFECT PAPER.

Paper sent into a printing office to print upon, without the extra
quantity which partly constitutes perfect paper; thus a ream of
imperfect paper consists of twenty quires of twenty-four sheets each,
which makes a ream containing 480 sheets; in this state it is termed
inside quires: sometimes, but rarely, it is sent in with the outside
quires, in which case there are not so many sheets in a ream. _See_
PAPER; also PERFECT PAPER.


IMPERIAL PRESS. _See_ SHERWIN AND COPE’S PRESS.


IMPOSING,

is the arrangement of the pages of a sheet, or of a form, in their
proper order on the stone, and the wedging of them up in a chase,
with a view to their being printed.

The knowledge of thus laying down pages, so that the sheets may
fold correctly when printed, is of essential consequence to every
compositor engaged on book work.

A workman would be held inexcusable who did not know how to lay
down with accuracy all the common sizes; viz. quartos, octavos,
and duodecimos: but even with this knowledge he is frequently at a
loss when at work upon sizes that do not frequently occur; and more
particularly so at the close of a volume where there are fragments,
which are required to be imposed together, for the purpose of saving
presswork and warehouse work.

A youth, who has just gone to the business, feels a natural pride in
showing that he is making progress; and he wishes to improve himself
without having continually to appeal to his instructor; but he does
not possess the means.

The young man from the country, who has been educated in a house
where there has not been much book work done, which is generally
the case, and who, of course, is not very expert at his profession,
when he comes to work in an extensive book house in town, feels his
deficiency, and more particularly if he has to lay down his pages in
a large companionship; he does not like to acknowledge his ignorance,
nor to ask for information: he has consequently to work his way at a
great disadvantage.

Under these circumstances it frequently happens that the pages are
laid down wrong, which causes a great deal of trouble and loss
of time in their rectification; and this trouble is considerably
increased if the work be on a small type and solid. In this case,
if the cords have been taken off, it is not advisable to transpose
the pages without wetting them, for fear of breaking the matter, or
at least squabbling it; the form has then to be dried, before the
pressman can pull another proof.

All the works on Printing hitherto published, are deficient in
giving a sufficient variety of tables for imposing, as a reference
for the workman, as well as for the reader and the master printer.
This deficiency of reference occasionally causes the compositor
to re-impose his forms, as I just now observed, and also in many
instances to cut up new furniture.

To remedy this inconvenience I have considerably exceeded the number
of what has been given in any other work, by adding such tables as
are likely to occur in practice, and to which there has hitherto been
no reference.

I have given all the Tables of Imposition that are in Luckombe and in
Stower, except a half-sheet of sixty-fours, although I disapprove of
the arrangement of the pages in many of them, from their not cutting
up or folding in the most convenient manner; yet, as they have been
acted on in a great number of instances, I would not reject them,
it being advisable in reprints to preserve uniformity, which may
enable the proprietor to make up a few more copies from the waste of
both editions. I have added several, in which I think there is an
improvement in these particulars.

I have also endeavoured to make each size complete, by giving a
sheet, a half sheet, a quarter of a sheet, and the usual fragments
that occur; varying the arrangement of the pages in a great number of
instances, to suit the different ways of folding the paper.

The whole of the signatures in each form are given, that they may
serve as a guide in laying down the pages, particularly where there
are a great number in a sheet; they might then all be taken out, if
thought proper, except the first, and the first in the offcut, which
are the only ones I would retain, and all that are necessary, the
others causing the bottoms of the pages to look unsightly; for the
person who folds the sheets has only to keep the signature at the
outside, and the pages must be folded right.

When works are in half sheets, it is advantageous to work two
together, as it enables the bookseller to deliver a single copy in
sheets without cutting up the back; and also at the conclusion of a
work that is in sheets where there are two half sheets, as it saves
time and trouble in the warehouse; it not being necessary to divide
the sheet and insert a half in each volume, but the whole sheet may
be gathered in the volume to which either of the signatures belongs;
by which means there will be fewer mistakes, and fewer imperfections
required.

When we arrive at a great number of pages in a sheet, they resolve
themselves into the same order as quartos, octavos, and duodecimos;
and in these cases I have repeated the imposition rather than refer
to another size, which is not always very clearly understood when
two, three, or more sheets are combined. Upon this principle I have
repeated the half sheets, quarter sheets, and fragments, so as to
make each size complete in itself.

It is usual when a fragment at the end of a volume makes six pages to
impose it as eight: in this case there are two blank pages. Sometimes
the author fills these up, by adding to the text; at other times the
bookseller occupies them with advertisements of other publications in
which he is interested.

When a compositor lays down his pages, it might prevent mistakes if
he looked over them to see that they were right before he untied the
page cords; and it is a good check to examine the folios of every
two adjoining pages in a quarter, to see that their sum makes one
more than the number of pages in the sheet, or half sheet: thus, in
a sheet of folio, 1 and 4, equal to 5, are imposed together; in a
quarto, 1 and 8; in an octavo, 1 and 16; in a duodecimo, 1 and 24;
in sixteens, 1 and 32; in eighteens, 1 and 36; and so in every other
size: and this combination continues through all the other adjoining
pages, according to the order in which they lie on the stone, calling
the first page in the sheet 1, the second 2, and so on in succession.

The short cross is always better in the middle of the chase, if the
margin will allow it; as it divides the matter more equally, and the
form is safer when it is locked up.

If it be the first sheet of a work that is to be imposed, or it
be found necessary to increase the number of sheets in chase, the
compositor applies to the overseer, or to the person who has the care
of the materials, for a pair of chases.

The pages being laid upon the stone in their proper order, and as
near the required distance from each other as can be determined by
the eye, the compositor then places his chases; he takes one with
both hands and lays the off side or end, as it may be, on the stone
at the outer side of his pages, and lowers the near side gradually,
till it lies flat on the stone, taking care that the inner edges of
the chase and the cross bars do not rest on the face of the pages to
injure them, and that the grooves in the short cross are upwards.

The furniture has now to be cut for the sheet; but previous to doing
this it is necessary to ascertain what kinds of it will be wanted,
by trying the margin with a sheet of paper of the work, otherwise a
great risk is run of cutting an expensive article to waste, and of
incurring also a loss of time, both of which should be avoided if
possible. The manner of making margin will be explained under its
proper head. _See_ MARGIN.

I would recommend that the headsticks in octavos should be in two
pieces, each of them a little longer than the page is wide; this will
allow the gutters to be a little longer than the page, so that they
will come close to the footsticks at the bottom, and at the other end
will go between the headsticks, thus securing the inside of the two
pages, without any risk of the gutters binding when locked up, which
they are apt to do when cut to the precise length of the page, as is
the custom when the headsticks for each quarter are in one piece. The
gutters thus being equal to about three picas more in length than
the page, will answer for other works where the page is of the same
width, but different in length.

The headsticks and gutters being arranged, the compositor will cut
his backs a little longer than the page, and these abutting against
the headsticks that project beyond the page towards the cross, will
secure that side. The sidesticks should be of the full length of the
page, and abut against the headsticks on the outside of the form. The
footsticks may be a trifle shorter than the width of two pages and
the gutter; for as there should always be a line of quadrats, or a
reglet cut to measure, at the foot of each page, the footstick may be
a pica shorter without danger, on this account, of any thing falling
out, when the form is lifted, and it thus prevents the side and foot
sticks from binding when locked up.

By cutting the furniture in this manner, the compositor will at once
perceive that all his pages will be secure, and that the furniture
cannot bind in any place when locked up. The gutter is pushed down
to the footstick, and extends beyond the top of the pages; the two
headsticks abut against the gutter, and project a little beyond the
sides of their pages; the back is pushed up to the headstick, and
extends a little below the bottom of the page; the footstick abuts
against the back, and by being about a pica short prevents the
sidestick from binding against it; and the sidestick abuts against
the head, and extends the full length of the page: neither is there
any impediment to driving the quoins.

I would never cut the heads and the backs of such a length as to
project beyond the side and foot sticks; for when they do, they are
in the way of the shooting stick, if a quoin has been driven close
up, when the form has to be unlocked. Neither should the headstick
project so much as the thickness of the back; nor the extra length of
the gutter be so much as the headstick; otherwise they will bind and
prevent the form from rising.

When the sidestick or footstick is so long as to project one beyond
the other, it prevents the quoin from passing, and in unlocking
causes a great deal of trouble to get it out; I have, in such cases,
frequently seen the sidestick broken or spoiled in the attempt,
and a page squabbled or broken. This arises from carelessness or
idleness, both which generally cause more trouble ultimately than
if the work were properly performed in the first instance. If it be
thought unnecessary or wasteful to cut down side or foot sticks for
a job, or a pamphlet, when there are none of a proper length in the
house, a piece of furniture taken out of the drawer of the proper
length and width, and placed inside next the page, will remedy the
inconvenience, and cause the quoin to be driven with ease.

When placing the furniture about the pages leave the ends of the
page cords out, so that they may be easily taken off, without the
necessity of disturbing the pages to find the end, which will be the
case if they be tucked in.

The furniture being now round the pages, I would recommend to the
compositor to put some quoins round the form, not with any particular
care that they fit, but merely to secure the pages, and by their
means to push them up close to the heads, backs, and gutters.

After having taken a page cord from a page push up that page close
to the furniture at the back and head, by means of the side and foot
stick, to prevent the letters at the ends of the lines from falling
down, and also tighten the quoins gently with your fingers.

All the page cords being taken off, and the pages pushed up close
at the sides and heads, it will next be necessary to examine
particularly that the margin be right; as also to put one or two
scaleboards in all the backs and the heads between the furniture
and the crosses. These scaleboards enable the pressmen to make
register if there be any inequality in the furniture or the crosses,
by changing their situations, or taking some of them away; they also
enable the compositor to make the distance between the pages in the
backs and heads uniform, which should always be the case; and no form
of book work that has to be printed on both sides of the paper should
ever be imposed without them. But scaleboard is never used in the
gutters.

The form has now to be quoined, which many compositors are in the
habit of doing very carelessly, thinking that if the form lifts it
is quite sufficient. This is an erroneous opinion, and frequently
causes errors from the slovenly manner in which the quoining is done,
letters and even lines dropping out when the form is laid on the
press, or taken off, which do not always get replaced correctly; and
the pages are more likely to fall out if they stand a few days at
the end of a bulk. As I have previously described the imposing of an
octavo, I shall continue my observations with respect to that size,
but the principle is the same whatever the size may be. I would have
two quoins for each sidestick, not put in indiscriminately, but the
furthest quoin when driven tight, to be about three quarters of an
inch from the broad end of the sidestick, which will allow room for
the shooting stick in unlocking, as also for the form being tightened
if the furniture shrinks; and the other quoin when driven tight to be
its whole length fairly within the sidestick, because this end of the
stick being thin, will be liable to spring from the page if the quoin
be driven far in, and thus leave the letters behind insecure, and in
danger of falling out: I would have two for the footstick in the same
situations, and a third in the middle to cover the end of the gutter.
Each quarter, of a form of octavo, thus quoined, will be perfectly
secure when the quoins are driven tight, provided the pages be made
up to the same length, and the lines properly justified; should this
not be the case, the compositor will be obliged to vary the quoining,
to meet the evil of bad workmanship.

Before he tightens his quoins he examines whether the pages in the
same quarter be of equal length, which he does by pressing against
the footstick with his thumbs, and raising it a little from the
stone; if it lifts up with it equally the ends of both the pages
against which it presses, he is satisfied they are right, and tries
the other quarters in the same manner; if he finds any of the pages
short, he examines them to find out where the deficiency is and
supplies it; sometimes a lead is wanting, sometimes a line. This will
arise occasionally from the carelessness of some compositors who will
not take the trouble of cutting a gauge by which to make up their
pages, but do it by counting the lines; they sometimes omit a line,
sometimes have a line too much, and sometimes are equally incorrect
with their leads: in other cases I have known gauges cut carelessly
of an improper length, which causes the same evil; and it also
occasionally arises from having the gauges of three or four different
works cut on the same piece of reglet, and mistaking one for the
other. _See_ GAUGE.

I should now push the quoins up all round with my fingers, to confine
the pages slightly, and then plane the form down gently by striking
the planer with the fist; if any letters stand up they are easily
pressed down by this mode of proceeding, without injuring their face;
after this is done, it is necessary to examine the sides of the
pages, to see that no letters have slipped out of their places at the
ends of the lines, which is frequently the case when pages which have
been tied up have lain under the frame some time; it may also happen
in taking the page cords off, particularly if they be knotted. Having
examined the pages, and rectified any thing that was found amiss,
which is easily done in this state of the form, I should gently
tighten the quoins all round the form in an equal manner with the
mallet and shooting stick, and then plane down, but not violently;
if any letters stand up, from some substance being underneath, as a
space, or a letter, or a bit of the page paper, which will sometimes
get torn off and remain, it will be better to omit planing that part
down for the present, as it would only injure the type and answer
no good purpose: the quoins should then be driven as tight as is
necessary, still doing it regularly and equally all round the form,
when the form should be planed down again, which may be done with
firmer blows than before, still omitting the part where the letters
stand up.

The form may now be lifted from the stone at the front edge, just
sufficient to allow the compositor to see whether it will rise or
not, but not so high as that a letter would drop out; if it dances,
it must be dropped down again upon the stone, and the lines tightened
by thrusting the point of a bodkin between some of the words, and
tightening the quoins; thus bad workmanship causes fudges, and in
this case is never safe, for the letters are always in danger of
being drawn out at press. But it may arise from a letter having
slipped down at the end of a line: in this case the remedy is easy,
to unlock the quarter and put the letter in its proper place; when
this is done, and the form will rise, take the substance that was
under it completely away, lay the form down again, loosen the quoins
in that quarter, then plane it down, and lock it up as before
directed.

The forms should now be brushed over with the letter brush, and
taken to the proof press, and the pressman should be told to pull
them,--In some houses the proof press is in the press room, in that
case the compositor either calls out “Proof,” or asks, “Who’s in
Proofs?” and then tells the party how it is to be pulled, First
Proof, or Clean; sometimes the proof press is in the composing room,
and the compositor either calls out “Proof” to them, or rings a bell,
different houses having different customs in this respect.

I would always put the flat side of the furniture upwards, as it
is more convenient for the pressmen, when it is necessary to place
bearers on the frisket; since they operate better on this surface
than on the hollow side, and can be placed on any part of it.

In my opinion it is preferable to have each part of the furniture in
one piece, where it is practicable; as, for instance, the gutters,
the backs, and the heads; which prevents the pieces from being
transposed, and the margin from getting wrong: but sometimes pieces
will be wanted of a width that is not equal to any regular size, and
then two must be used.

To prevent as much as possible one piece of furniture from being
mistaken for another in the hurry of business, I would cut all the
gutters of one sheet of a precise length; so also would I do with the
backs, as also with the heads; but each sort should be of a different
length from that of the others;--thus, though all the gutters would
be exactly of a length, yet would they be of a different length from
that of the heads and backs, and so of the others; and thus they
would be easily distinguished from each other, and mistakes would be
prevented.

The sheet being now imposed, the stone must be cleared; the saw
and saw block put in their places--the shears--the mallet, planer,
and shooting stick--the surplus furniture--the scaleboard--the
quoins--and every other article; for in most houses there is a fine
for leaving a foul stone. The compositor will tie up his page cords,
and if he has any companions will return to them their proportion.

In imposing a sheet from the furniture of one that has been
worked off, in the regular process of business, there are certain
circumstances to be attended to, which are frequently omitted:--The
chase and furniture of one form should always be used for a similar
form; that is, the chase and furniture of the outer form should be
again used for an outer form, and the chase and furniture of the
inner form should be again used for an inner form; they should also
be put round the pages in the same order in which they were put
about those of the preceding forms. For want of care or thought in
these apparently trifling circumstances a great deal of trouble,
inconvenience, and loss of time, are frequently incurred; for the
register will be almost sure to be wrong when this is neglected, and
then the forms must be unlocked, and the scaleboards changed, some of
them having to be taken out, or fresh ones to be inserted, and this
accompanied by a great deal of dissatisfaction.

I have found it to be a saving of time to be a little methodical in
imposing; I take out my quoins and lay them on the adjoining pages
in their regular order, then, after the chase has been put over the
pages, and the furniture about them, there is no loss of time in
replacing the quoins, or in finding the proper situation for each of
them: the page cords are then taken off; the quoins tightened; the
form planed down, &c., as detailed in the preceding paragraphs for
imposing the first sheet of a work.

It should always be borne in mind that the quoins ought to be
tightened regularly and uniformly round the form; for if one quarter
be locked up at once before the quoins are tightened in the other
quarters, the whole will be distorted, and the pressmen will have
great difficulty in making register.

After the furniture has been taken from a form for the purpose of
imposing another, it will be the means of preventing the matter for
distribution from going into pie if the compositor tie a cord about
each page; at least it may prevent an accident, and save him some
trouble.

The chases for a sheet ought always to be in pairs; for if they be of
different sizes, or the rims of different thickness, it causes the
pressmen to lose time in making register, when both forms are worked
at the same press, and often occasions the spoiling of two or three
sheets of paper before that object is accomplished.

Before the compositor locks up his form, but after the pages are
pushed up close to the backs and the heads, he should cut a gauge
to fit exactly the intervals between the backs and the heads; and
a sheet should never be carried into the press room for press,
without the margin having been tried by this gauge to see that it is
right, and to correct it, if it should be wrong: for as the pressmen
have frequently occasion to alter the scaleboards in working the
reiteration, this alteration will necessarily affect the furniture of
the succeeding sheet. I have always used two small pieces of clean
reglet, brevier or longprimer, and have cut them to the precise
length; I wrote on both in ink the name of the work to prevent
mistakes, as also the words ‘Back’ and ‘Head’ on each respectively;
made a hole through them with my bodkin, tied them together with a
piece of page cord, and hung them on a nail within my frame, so that
they were always ready for use.

I shall now enumerate the tables of imposition in the following
pages, and add observations where it may appear necessary, to make
them as clear as it is in my power to do, not only to facilitate
the operation, but in many instances to give information that may
be of service; and in some cases to accommodate the bookbinder, who
is seldom thought of in a printing office, but who, in my opinion,
ought to be constantly considered: for I hold that the binding of a
book should be always kept in view, as we are all anxious to see how
our work looks when it is splendidly dressed by his skill; and it
would consequently not be just if we did not do all in our power to
accommodate him: stating this opinion will also show my reason for
making some of the observations, as it is a point that has hitherto
been neglected in all practical works on printing.

I shall also notice the errors, where they occur, of my predecessors,
not for the sake of finding fault, or of depreciating their labours,
but to save trouble to the workman; for, by some unaccountable cause,
wherever Luckombe has made a mistake, or committed an error, it has
been copied by subsequent writers, who do not appear to have examined
his arrangement of the pages, but to have taken it for granted they
were right, and have thus continued his errors.

The writers since Smith have not, I think, reasoned correctly on
this part of a practical work; they seem to have made a merit of
not adding to this department, by attending too strictly to an
observation of his, saying that there may be many more fanciful ways
of folding a sheet of paper. So there may, with which it may not be
necessary to encumber a book; but why reject those that are useful
and of frequent occurrence? why omit giving the mode of imposing
fragments that continually occur at the end of a work? and that
generally cause loss of time in arranging them, which might easily
have been avoided; which omission I have endeavoured to supply: for
this is the part of a work on printing that may be equally useful as
a reference to the experienced workman as to the novice, and which I
have frequently seen much wanted.

Smith’s words are, after enumerating the different Tables of
Imposition which he has given--“More Irregular Sizes we have not
thought fit to introduce; else we might have drawn out Schemes for
Imposing Six’s, 10’s, 14’s, 20’s, 28’s, 30’s, 40’s, 42’s, 50’s, 56’s,
60’s, 80’s, 100’s, and 112’s; these, and several more being Sizes
that have been found out not so much for use as out of fancy, to show
the possibility of folding a piece of paper into so many various
forms.”--p. 257. Upon this passage have all subsequent writers formed
their excuse for leaving the different methods of imposing pages in
an imperfect and erroneous state: the errors commenced with Luckombe.

As it may facilitate reference, I have given in the following
enumeration the initials of the different authors in whose works
the same forms will be found.--M. refers to Moxon; Sm. to Smith;
L. to Luckombe; St. to Stower; J. to Johnson; H. to Hansard; Ma.
to Magrath; and Mas. to Mason. Where there are no initials, the
arrangement has not, to my knowledge, been given before in any
English book, and is only to be found in this work.


TABLES OF IMPOSITION.

When imposing the first sheet of a new work, it may be serviceable to
refer to the preceding observations, for a choice of the best method;
and also for directions how to transpose the pages in working the
reiteration, when a transposition is required.


_The running Number corresponds with that in the Enumeration._

_Enumeration of the_ TABLES OF IMPOSITION _in the preceding pages,
with Observations, and reference to the page in which each will be
found._

  1. Abstract of Title Deeds. J.--H.                              Page 335

  Abstracts of Title Deeds of Estates are in single leaves, and all
  the margin is on the left side of the paper; they are usually
  imposed two pages together, to save expense in press-work. They
  are stitched together at the corner.

  2. Sheet of Folio. M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                    335

  3. Sheet of Folio. Hebrew                                            335

  4. Two sheets of Folio, Quired. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                 335

  5. Three sheets of Folio, Quired                                     336

  Imposing in Quires was formerly much used, when books were more
  commonly printed in folio than they now are. It may be carried
  to any extent, by taking care that the folios of the two pages
  in each form of the first Signature make one more than the
  whole number quired: thus, if the quire consists of 24 pages,
  the Imposition of each form will be consecutively 1 and 24--23
  and 2--3 and 22--21 and 4--5 and 20--19 and 6--7 and 18--17 and
  8--9 and 16--15 and 10--11 and 14--13 and 12; and so for the
  succeeding forms, taking this order of the pages.


  6. Half a Sheet of Folio. M.                                         336

  7. Sheet of Quarto M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                    336

  8. Sheet of Quarto. Hebrew                                           336

  9. Two Half Sheets of Quarto, worked together. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.  337

  10. Half Sheet of Quarto. M.--Sm.--St.--J.--H.                       337

  Half Sheet of Broad Quarto. Sm.--J.--As the pages are laid down
  as in No. 10, I have not repeated the arrangement.

  11. Half Sheet of Quarto. Hebrew                                     337

  12. Two Sheets of Quarto, Quired                                     337

  This Imposition may be useful where a pamphlet makes but two
  Sheets.

  13. Sheet of Broad Quarto. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                      338

  14. Sheet of Octavo. M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                  338

  15. Sheet of Octavo. Hebrew. Sm.--St.--J.--H.                        338

  16. Sheet of Broad Octavo. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                      338

  17. Half Sheet of Octavo. M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                   339

  18. Half Sheet of Octavo. Hebrew.                                    339

  19. Two Half Sheets of Octavo, worked together.
      Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                       339

  I prefer this method of imposing two half sheets of Octavo, which
  cut up in the regular fold of the paper, to having the signatures
  in slips on each side of the long cross.

  20. Sheet of Octavo with two Signatures, 12 pages and 4.
      St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                                339

  The four pages are here imposed to cut out of the middle of the
  Sheet: being in the order of the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th. They
  might also be imposed as the 1st, 2d, 15th, and 16th; both these
  methods are convenient to the bookbinder.

  21. Two Quarter Sheets of Octavo, worked together.
      Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                       339

  22. Two Quarter Sheets of Octavo. Hebrew. Worked together            339

  23. Sheet of Twelves, No. 1. M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.          340

  The pages of this sheet are arranged in the customary manner, the
  first page of the offcut being in the outer form.

  24. Sheet of Twelves, No. 2.                                         340

  By imposing a sheet of twelves in this manner, the first
  signature of the offcut being in the inner form, it rises more
  conveniently for the bookbinder when folding; as it saves him
  the trouble of turning the offcut over every sheet, and it is no
  inconvenience to the printer.

  25. Sheet of Twelves, to fold without cutting. L.--St.--J.--H.       340

  26. Sheet of Twelves. Hebrew                                         341

  27. Two Half Sheets of Twelves, worked together, No. 1. H.           341

  The signatures of these two half sheets when quired, will rise
  regularly when collated, so as to be easily perceived both by
  the warehouseman and the bookbinder, and be less liable to be
  overlooked than the following. I give the preference to this
  arrangement.

  28. Two Half Sheets of Twelves, worked together, No. 2.
      Sm.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                           341

  I give this arrangement of the pages of two half sheets of
  Twelves to be worked together, because it is generally adopted;
  but the second signature is hid in the sheet, and may easily be
  overlooked, so as to cause a mistake, both by the warehouseman
  and the bookbinder. I prefer the preceding arrangement.

  29. Half Sheet of Twelves. M.--Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                  342

  30. Half Sheet of Twelves, to fold without cutting. L.--St.--J.--H.  342

  31. Half Sheet of Twelves. Hebrew                                    342

  32. Sheet of Twelves, with two Signatures. 20 pages and 4            342

  33. Sheet of Twelves, with two Signatures. 16 pages and 8.
      Sm.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                           343

  34. Sheet of Twelves, with three Signatures. 12, 8, and 4 pages      343

  35. Sheet of Twelves, with three Signatures. Thrice 8 pages          343

  The offcut forms one of the portions of eight pages; the other
  two are imposed as two half sheets of octavo.

  36. Half Sheet of Twelves, with two Signatures. 8 pages and 4.
      Sm.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                                           344

  37. Eight pages of Twelves. St.--J.--H.--Mas.                        344

  38. Sheet of Long Twelves. Music way, No. 1                          344

  This sheet cuts into three portions of eight pages each, which
  are inserted into each other.

  39. Sheet of Long Twelves. Music way, No. 2                          345

  There is an offcut of eight pages in this sheet, which forms the
  inset.

  40. Sheet of Long Twelves. Music way. With two Signatures.
      16 pages and 8. S.                                               345

  Stower terms this ‘A Sheet of Long Twelves,’ although it is a
  sheet with two signatures, composed of sixteen pages and eight
  pages.

  41. Half Sheet of Long Twelves. Music way                            346

  This half sheet perfects as an octavo, and the four middle pages
  cut out and form the inset.

  42. Sheet of Long Twelves, No. 1.                                    346

  The first page of the offcut in this and the following sheet is
  imposed in the inner form, for the reason given in No. 24.

  43. Sheet of Long Twelves, No. 2.                                    347

  In this and the preceding sheet the paper of the sixteen pages
  folds differently; the first fold of No. 1. is in the back, as an
  octavo; the first fold of No. 2. is in the head as a quarto.

  44. Sheet of Long Twelves, with two signatures. 16 pages and 8.
      No. 1. L.--St.--J.--H.                                           347

  Luckombe and the subsequent writers term this a ‘Sheet of Long
  Twelves;’ it is in fact two fragments, one of sixteen pages, and
  one of eight pages.

  45. Sheet of Long Twelves, with two Signatures. 16 pages and 8.
      No. 2                                                            348

  The sixteen pages of this sheet and the preceding, fold as No.
  43. and No. 42.

  46. Half Sheet of Long Twelves                                       348

  47. Sheet of Square Twelves                                          349

  A sheet of square twelves is imposed the same as a sheet of
  common twelves; but I have inserted it, because the chase is laid
  over the form differently: the short cross should be the same as
  for octavos, and the long cross should be for the offcut.

  Half sheets and fragments are laid down the same as common
  twelves.

  48. Two Half Sheets of Long Twelves, worked together                 349

  This sheet is perfected as an octavo, and the four middle pages
  form the inset.

  49. Sheet of Sixteens. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                          349

  50. Sheet of Sixteens. Hebrew                                        350

  This and the preceding sheet fold without cutting.

  51. Two Half Sheets of Sixteens worked together                      350

  52. Sheet of Sixteens, with two Signatures. 24 pages and 8           350

  53. Half Sheet of Sixteens. Sm.--St.--J.--H.                         351

  54. Half Sheet of Sixteens. Hebrew                                   351

  55. Two Quarter Sheets of Sixteens                                   351

  56. Sheet of Long Sixteens                                           351

  57. Two Half Sheets of Long Sixteens, worked together                352

  58. Half Sheet of Long Sixteens                                      352

  59. Two Quarter Sheets of Long Sixteens                              352

  60. Sheet of Eighteens, with one Signature. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.     353

  Luckombe calls this ‘A common Sheet of Eighteens.’ I suppose
  at that time it was the customary way of imposing a sheet of
  eighteens; in my opinion it is inferior to No. 62. There are four
  insets in it--3 of four pages each, and 1 of eight pages.

  61. Sheet of Eighteens with three Signatures. No. 1. Sm.--St.--H.    353

  This imposition cuts into three slips the longest way of the
  sheet of paper; and the heads of the pages on one of them are the
  raw edge of the paper, which will cause additional trouble to
  the pressman and to the bookbinder, without being attended with
  any advantage:--If the compositor have not made his pages up to
  a precise length, the pressman will have to unlock the forms and
  rectify them, to make register; and the bookbinder will have
  to trim each of them with a pair of scissars. It may be avoided
  by turning the pages of this slip round, and placing the heads
  against the heads of the other signature, if a sheet should be
  imposed according to this arrangement. It is certainly inferior
  to No. 62.

  62. Sheet of Eighteens, with three Signatures, as three Half
      Sheets of Twelves. J.--Mas. No. 2                                354

  This is now the usual method of imposing a sheet of eighteens; it
  cuts up equal to three half sheets of twelves, and is the most
  convenient mode both to the pressman and bookbinder, as it is in
  the regular way of their business.

  63. Sheet of Eighteens, with three Signatures. Hebrew                354

  64. Sheet of Eighteens, to fold without cutting. L.--St.--J.--H.     355

  Luckombe has reversed every page of this sheet in his work, so
  that the first page would be at the last end of the sheet, the
  same as Hebrew. Smith has a sheet of eighteens under this title,
  but it has three Signatures in it.

  65. Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 24 pages and 12.
      No. 1. Sm.--St.--J.--H.                                          355

  66. Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 24 pages and 12,
      as a Sheet of Twelves and Half Sheet of Twelves. No. 2           356

  These two last sheets will only be useful when a volume of
  eighteens is worked in sheets with one Signature in each, which
  is not often done; I should give the preference to No. 2.

  67. Half Sheet of Eighteens. Sm.--St.--J.--H.--Mas.                  356

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages 11,
  8 and 7, 12--put 11 and 8 in the place of 7 and 12; and 7 and 12
  in the place of 11 and 8.

  68. Half Sheet of Eighteens. Hebrew                                  356

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 8,
  11 and 12, 7, in the same manner as was directed in No. 67.

  69. Half Sheet of Eighteens, without transposing the pages.
      St.--J.--H.                                                      357

  Mr. Stower, in his Printer’s Grammar, says, “We have also given a
  plan for imposing a half sheet of eighteens, without transposing
  the pages.”

  I acknowledge that much time will be saved in the warehouse work,
  and that it will be more convenient for the printer to do it in
  this manner; but the saving of trouble, and the convenience of
  doing work in a particular way, are not always to be attended
  to. How will the sheet look when cut up?--There will be three
  signatures; the first will have twelve pages, the same as half a
  sheet of twelves; the second will consist of two single leaves;
  and the third of one leaf, thus having three separate leaves in
  a half sheet; that is, six single leaves in a sheet, which are
  charged in binding the same as plates. A collection of plays
  published separately in eighteens, which is not uncommon, will
  when completed contain many half sheets, and, if printed in this
  manner, will be a considerable additional expense in binding
  a number of complete sets. This will cause dissatisfaction in
  the master printer’s employers, as it is a principle that ought
  always to be acted on, not to increase the expenditure, when it
  can be avoided.

  70. Sixteen pages of Eighteens. Sm.--St.--J.--H.                     357

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 7,
  10 and 9, 8; put 7 and 10 in the place of 9 and 8; and 9 and 8 in
  the place of 7 and 10.

  In working sixteen pages, or eight pages, of eighteens, there
  will be two blank pages in each half of the sheet, except it be
  filled up with advertisements, catalogue, or other matter.

  71. Half a Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 16 pages and 2   357

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 7,
  10 and 9, 8, as in No. 70.

  72. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 14 pages and 4     357

  After the white paper is printed off, transpose the four pages,
  37, 40 and 39, 38, as directed in No. 70.

  73. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 12 pages and 6     358

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 13,
  18 and 17, 14, as directed in No. 70.

  74. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 10 pages and 8     358

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 73,
  80 and 79, 74, as directed in No. 70.

  75. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with two Signatures. 8 pages and 8      358

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 37,
  44 and 43, 38, as directed in No. 70.

  76. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with three Signatures. 10 pages, 4,
      and 4                                                            358

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 73,
  76 and 75, 74, as directed in No. 70.

  77. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with three Signatures. 8 pages, 8,
      and 2                                                            359

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, 37,
  44 and 43, 38, as directed in No. 70.

  78. Half Sheet of Eighteens, with four Signatures. Four times
      4 pages                                                          359

  After the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages,
  85, 88 and 87, 86, as directed in No. 70.

  In printing collections of plays in eighteens, where each play
  has separate folios, fragments in every variety arise. When one
  of four pages occurs, it will perhaps be adviseable, if the
  number be large, and the presswork not in a forward state, to
  make a full form of them, by setting the matter up five times:
  when the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages, as
  directed in No. 70.; also take out the first and fourth pages of
  one of the portions of four pages which occupy the place of the
  two blanks in No. 78, and put the third and the second in their
  place.

  79. Sheet of Twenties. No. 1. L.--St.--J.--H.                        359

  I do not approve of this arrangement; for the sheet cuts into
  five slips, four of which are insets--otherwise they must have
  five different signatures.

  80. Sheet of Twenties. No. 2                                         360

  After the offcut is separated, the first and second folds of the
  remainder are the same as a duodecimo.

  81. Sheet of Twenties. No. 3                                         360

  After the offcut is separated, the first and second folds of the
  remainder are the same as a Quarto. I have placed the first
  signature of the offcut in the inner form, for the reason
  assigned in No. 23.

  This and the preceding arrangement are preferable to No. 1, as
  there is only one offcut in each, which is inserted in the middle
  when folded; the other pages are imposed as a sheet of sixteens.

  82. Sheet of Twenties, with two Signatures. 32 pages and 8           361

  83. Sheet of Twenties, with two Signatures. 24 pages and 16          361

  84. Two Half Sheets of Twenties, worked together                     362

  85. Half a Sheet of Twenties                                         362

  86. Half a Sheet of Twenties, with two Signatures. 16 pages and
      4 J.                                                             362

  87. Half a Sheet of Twenties, with two Signatures. 12 pages and 8    363

  88. Two Half Sheets of Twenty-fours, worked together                 363

  What Stower calls Twenty-fours are longer and narrower than what
  he calls Long Twenty-fours: I have reversed the terms, and called
  his Twenty-fours, Long Twenty-fours, and vice versâ.

  89. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours. No. 1                              364

  90. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours. No. 2. Sm.--St.--J.--H.            364

  These four writers term this arrangement of the pages, ‘the
  Sixteen-way.’

  The difference between No. 1. and No. 2. is, that, when the inset
  is taken off, the first fold of No. 1. is in the head; and that
  of No. 2. is in the back, as a sheet of octavo.

  91. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours, to fold without cutting. L.--S.    365

  92. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours, with two Signatures. 20 pages
      and 4                                                            365

  93. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours, with two Signatures. 16 pages
      and 8. L.--St.--J.--H.                                           366

  94. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours, with three Signatures. 8 pages
      each                                                             366

  95. Quarter of a Sheet of Twenty-fours. H.                           366

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four middle
  pages; put 5 in the place of 7,--6 in the place of 8,--7 in the
  place of 5,--and 8 in the place of 6.

  96. Two Half Sheets of Twenty-fours, worked together. Hebrew         367

  97. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours. Hebrew. No. 1                      368

  98. Half a Sheet of Twenty-fours. Hebrew. No. 2                      368

  99. Two Half Sheets of Long Twenty-fours, worked together.
      Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                                             369

  Luckombe has transposed the pages of this table in his work. I
  have put the first page of the second signature in the inner
  form, which causes it to rise better in collating and folding:
  Stower has it in the outer.

  100. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours. No. 1                        369

  101. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours. No. 2. L.--St.--J.--H.       370

  102. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours, to fold without cutting.
       L.--St.--J.--H.                                                 370

  103. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours, with two Signatures.
       20 pages and 4                                                  370

  104. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours, with two Signatures.
       16 pages and 8. Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                            371

  Luckombe has placed the foot of each page where the head should
  be, in the range commencing with page 1.

  105. Two Half Sheets of Long Twenty-fours, worked together. Hebrew   371

  106. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours. Hebrew. No. 1                372

  107. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours. Hebrew. No. 2                372

  108. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours, with two Signatures.
       20 pages and 4. Hebrew                                          372

  109. Half a Sheet of Long Twenty-fours, with two Signatures.
       16 pages and 8. Hebrew                                          373

  110. Two Half Sheets of Square Twenty-fours, worked together         373

  111. Half a Sheet of Square Twenty-fours. L.--St.--J.                374

  112. Sheet of Thirty-twos. No. 1                                     374

  113. Sheet of Thirty-twos. No. 2. L.--St.--J.--H.                    375

  In my opinion No. 1. is a more preferable method of imposing a
  sheet of 32mo. than No. 2.; as the sheet in the first instance
  folds into the regular folio, then into quarto, octavo, square
  sixteens, and thirty-twos; whereas No. 2. folds into long folio,
  quarto, long octavo, &c.

  Both of them would be inconvenient, except for children’s books,
  tracts, and other temporary articles; as sixty-four pages in one
  signature would be too many to fold neatly for book work, for
  such purpose I should prefer four signatures in the sheet, each
  of which would be equal to a sheet of octavo.

  114. Two Half Sheets of Thirty-twos, worked together                 376

  115. Sheet of Thirty-twos, with two Signatures. 48 pages and 16      377

  The sheet in the first instance cuts up in the regular fold; the
  half sheet with signature B in it, folds into quarto, octavo,
  square sixteens, and thirty-twos; the other half sheet cuts
  up lengthways into two equal parts, containing sixteen pages
  each, one of which is an inset for signature B, the other forms
  signature C.

  116. Sheet of Thirty-twos, with two Signatures. 40 pages and 24      378

  The sheet cuts up in the regular fold, and the half sheet folds
  as No. 115.; the other half sheet cuts in two lengthways, one of
  which contains sixteen pages of signature C; the other sixteen
  pages cut in two, eight pages of which are an inset for signature
  B, the other eight are an inset for signature C.

  117. Sheet of Thirty-twos, with four Signatures. 16 pages in each.
       Sm.--St.--J.--H.                                                379

  I have arranged the signatures of this sheet differently from
  the preceding writers. They have the two first signatures on
  different half sheets: I have placed them on the same half sheet,
  and the third and fourth signatures on the other half sheet, so
  as to cause them to rise in a regular way.

  This sheet is equal to four sheets of octavo; two of which are
  imposed on each side of the long crosses in a pair of chases:
  eight pages of the first signature, the same as the outer form
  of a sheet of octavo, are laid down in the left hand quarter of
  a chase, the other eight pages, similar to the inner form of a
  sheet of octavo, are laid down in the right hand quarter of the
  other chase; the fourth signature is imposed in the two other
  quarters, which will lie together as the chases are upon the
  imposing stone; the second and third signatures are imposed in a
  similar manner on the other sides of the long crosses.

  118. Half a sheet of Thirty-twos. L.--St.--J.--H.                    380

  119. Half a Sheet of Thirty-twos, with two Signatures.
       24 pages and 8                                                  380

  120. Half a Sheet of Thirty-twos, with two Signatures.
       20 pages and 12                                                 380

  121. Half a Sheet of Thirty-twos, with four Signatures. 16 pages,
       8 pages, 4 pages, and 4 pages. J.--H.                           381

  122. Two Quarter Sheets of Thirty-twos, worked together.
       Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                                            381

  123. Sheet of Thirty-sixes, with three Signatures                    382

  This sheet perfects the same as a twelves. It cuts into three
  equal parts across the sheet, each portion of which contains all
  the pages in the signature.

  124. Sheet of Thirty-sixes, with six Signatures                      383

  This sheet cuts up into portions of eight pages and four pages
  each, the four pages forming an inset; so as to make each
  signature equal to a half sheet of twelves.

  125. Sheet of Thirty-sixes, with two Signatures. 60 pages and 12     384

  126. Two Half Sheets of Thirty-sixes, worked together                385

  127. Half a Sheet of Thirty-sixes. L.--St.--J.--H.                   386

  128. Half a sheet of Thirty-sixes, to fold without cutting.
       L.--St.--J.--H.                                                 386

  129. Half a Sheet of Thirty-sixes, with three Signatures             387

  This form perfects as an octavo. It folds as three half sheets of
  twelves.

  130. Half a Sheet of Thirty-sixes, with two Signatures. 24 pages
       and 12. Sm.--St.--J.--H.                                        387

  This form perfects as an octavo. The three last writers, in their
  works on printing, have made the middle twelve pages perfect foot
  to foot, so that they will be cut out at the head, and fold at
  the foot; I have reversed them, to cause them to be cut out at
  the foot, and fold at the head.

  131. Two Quarter Sheets of Thirty-sixes, worked together             388

  When the white paper is worked off, transpose the four pages,
  11, 8, and 7, 12, in signature B, and 29, 26, and 25, 30, in
  signature C, in the manner directed in No. 67. (half sheet of
  eighteens), for each of these quarter sheets is similar in
  arrangement to that form.

  132. Half a Sheet of Forties. No. 1. L.--St.--J.--H.                 388

  The sheet cuts up into five slips of one page in depth, four of
  which are insets; it appears to me an inconvenient method, which
  I have endeavoured to improve in the next article. It perfects as
  an octavo.

  133. Half a Sheet of Forties. No. 2                                  389

  In this arrangement the paper folds in the regular way, first
  into folio, then into quarto, octavo, sixteens, and thirty-twos,
  with one inset of eight pages. In my opinion it is preferable to
  the preceding method. It perfects as an octavo.

  134. Half a Sheet of Forties, with two Signatures. 32 pages and 8    389

  The arrangement of the 32 pages is the same as for half a sheet
  of thirty-twos, in No. 118. The 8 pages of signature C form the
  offcut.

  135. Half a Sheet of Forties, with two Signatures. 24 pages and 16   390

  136. Half a sheet of Forties, with three Signatures. 16 pages,
       16 pages, and 8                                                 390

  137. Two Quarter Sheets of Forties, worked together                  391

  138. Half a Sheet of Forty-eights, with three Signatures.
       Sm.--St.--J.--H.                                                391

  These writers have placed the first signatures on the different
  half sheets; I have placed them on the same half sheet. It is
  similar in the arrangement of the pages to three sheets of
  octavo, and perfects the same as a form of twelves.

  139. Quarter of a Sheet of Forty-eights. L.--St.--J.--H.             392

  The same arrangement of the pages as a sheet of twelves, and
  perfects as such.

  140. Quarter of a Sheet of Forty-eights, to fold without cutting.
       L.--St.--J.--H.                                                 392

  It is the same as a sheet of twelves without cutting.

  141. Two Quarter Sheets of Forty-eights, worked together. No. 1      392

  These are equal to two sheets of twelves, and are arranged on
  each side of the short cross, and perfect as a twelves.

  142. Two Quarter Sheets of Forty-eights, worked together. No. 2.
       L.--St.--J.--H.                                                 393

  These two quarter sheets are arranged on each side of the long
  cross, and perfect as an octavo.

  143. Quarter of a Sheet of Forty-eights, with two Signatures.
       16 pages and 8. L.--St.--J.--H.                                 393

  Stower imposes this form in three slips, and makes one of them an
  inset; and the slip with the first signature, has the heads of
  the pages to the raw edge of the paper: I have arranged the 16
  pages as a sheet of octavo, and the 8 pages of signature C form
  the offcut.

  144. Half a Sheet of Sixty-fours                                     394

  However much I disapprove of the arrangement of the pages in
  many of the Tables of Imposition in Luckombe’s and Stower’s
  works, on account of the uncustomary and inconvenient manner of
  the paper folding, yet I have given all that are in their books
  thus far, for the reason I stated in page 328; but when we come
  to sixty-fours, a size that is seldom printed, I think it is
  unnecessary to give more than one mode, and I omit the one that
  has been usually given, and insert in its place what I conceive
  to be an improvement. The old plan folded into folio, long

  146. Quarter of a Sheet of Sixty-fours. L.--St.--J.--H.              395

  The pages of this form are laid down in the same order as half a
  sheet of thirty-twos, No. 118.

  147. Quarter of a Sheet of Sixty-fours, with two Signatures.
       16 pages in each. L.--St.--J.--H.                               395

  I have varied from the old plan of imposing half a sheet of
  seventy-twos, nor did I think it of consequence to crowd the
  book unnecessarily with giving what I consider inferior modes of
  imposing in sizes that rarely occur. This form has been usually
  given to cut up into three slips the longest way of the paper; I
  have given it in the manner, that when perfected, it will cut up
  into six portions, with the pages of each the same as a sheet of
  twelves. It perfects as a twelves.

  150. Half a Sheet of Seventy-twos, with six Signatures               397

  This sheet when perfected cuts up into twelve portions, each of
  which is similar in the arrangement of the pages to half a sheet
  of twelves.

  The fragments of No. 149. will be imposed in the same order as
  those of a sheet of twelves; and those of 150, in the same order
  as those of half a sheet of twelves.

  151. Half a Sheet of Ninety-sixes, with four Signatures              398

  When perfected it cuts up into eight portions, each of which is
  similar to a sheet of twelves. It perfects as a twelves.

  I have placed the first signatures on the same half sheet; the
  preceding writers scattered them on both. It is laid down as six
  sheets of octavo, and perfects as an octavo.

  153. Half a Sheet of One Hundred and Twenty-eights.
       Sm.--L.--St.--J.--H.                                            400

  It is laid down as eight sheets of octavo, and perfects as an
  octavo.


IMPOSING STONE.

The stone on which the compositor imposes and corrects his forms. It
was formerly called the _Correcting Stone_.

Imposing stones are of different sizes to suit the business and the
situation in which they are placed, as they require a good light.
Some are made to hold two demy forms, others to hold three royals.
The stone should be of a firm texture, and its upper surface smooth,
so as not to wear the bottom of the types. Imposing stones are
sometimes saturated with oil, to lessen the friction. Their height
is about three feet, and the length of one calculated to contain two
demy forms is five feet, and its width two feet two inches.

The frame on which the stone rests, is fitted up with drawers for
furniture--one of these is for quoins, always the uppermost, one for
side sticks and foot sticks, one for broad and narrow, and one for
wider pieces;--these drawers are sometimes made of the whole width of
the frame, so as to draw out on either side, and sometimes there are
two within this width, one on each side.

Of late years, in some offices, cast iron has been substituted for
stone, the upper surface of which has been turned flat and smooth in
a lathe; and when a large size is wanted, two are attached together.

IMPRESSION SHEET.

A sheet of stout even paper, that fits exactly, without any play, the
inside of the outer tympan: this sheet is used in fine work to place
the overlays upon next to the parchment, and when a sheet of any work
is thus made ready at a press, the succeeding sheets of the same
work, at the same press, are made ready much more expeditiously,
than if all the overlays have to be placed for each sheet on the
tympan sheet.--_See_ MAKING READY.


IMPRINT.

The name and place of residence of the printer, put to all printed
articles, under the Act of Parliament of 39 George 3. c. 79., with

  the Printer of such Papers not being printed thereon.”

  Persons who have printed any Papers under the Authority of

  42 George 3. c. 23.--Annual Indemnity Act, s. 9. “And whereas,
  in an Act passed in the Thirty-ninth Year of the Reign of His
  present Majesty, intituled _An Act for the more effectual
  Suppression of Societies established for seditious and
  treasonable Purposes; and for better preventing treasonable
  and seditious Practices_, certain Provisions are contained to
  restrain the printing or publishing of any Papers or Books
  whatsoever, which should be meant or intended to be published or
  dispersed, without the Name and Place of Abode of the Printer
  thereof being printed thereon, with a certain Penalty on the
  Person printing, publishing, or dispersing, or assisting in
  publishing or dispersing the same contrary to the said Act: And
  whereas divers Papers being, or purporting to be Pleadings,
  Rules, Orders, Process, or other Proceedings in Courts of Law
  or Equity, or to be Parts of such Pleadings, Rules, Orders,
  Process, or other Proceedings, or to be Copies of the same, or
  of Parts thereof respectively, have, through Inadvertency and
  Mistake, and on the Supposition that such Papers were not within
  the Provisions of the said Act, been printed without the Name
  and Place of Abode of the Person printing the same being printed
  thereon as required by the said Act; be it further enacted, That
  every Person who shall, before the passing of this Act, have
  printed any Paper being, or purporting to be, any Pleading, Rule,
  Order, or any Process, or other Proceeding of or in any Court of
  Law or Equity, or to be any Part of such Pleading, Rule, Order,

  or incurred, for or by reason of any Offence alledged to have
  been committed against the said recited Act, by occasion of such
  printing, publishing, or dispersing, or assisting in publishing

  49 George 3. c. 69., intituled “An Act to indemnify Persons who
  have inadvertently printed, published, or dispersed Papers or
  Books without a full Description of the Place of Abode of the

  Thirty-ninth Year of His Majesty’s Reign.”

  s. 1. All Persons having printed Papers or Books with the Name of

  51 George 3. c. 65., intituled “An Act to explain and amend an
  Act, passed in the Thirty-ninth Year of His Majesty’s Reign,
  intituled _An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Societies
  established for seditious and treasonable Purposes, and for
  better preventing treasonable and seditious Practices_; so far as
  respects certain Penalties on Printers and Publishers.”

  s. 1. “Whereas an Act was passed in the Thirty-ninth Year of
  His present Majesty’s Reign, intituled _An Act for the more
  effectual Suppression of Societies established for seditious and
  treasonable Purposes, and for better preventing treasonable and
  seditious Practices_: And whereas, in and by the Twenty-seventh
  and Thirty-fifth Sections of the said Act, certain Provisions
  were made, that every Person who should print any Paper or Book,
  or publish or disperse, or assist in publishing or dispersing,
  any printed Paper or Book, without the Name and Place of Abode of
  the Printer being printed on such Paper or Book, in such Manner
  as by the said Act is specified, should forfeit and pay the Sum
  of Twenty Pounds for every Copy of such Paper so published or
  dispersed by him; to be recovered before any Justice or Justices
  of the Peace for the County, Stewartry, Riding, City, Town, or
  Place in which such Penalty should be incurred: Add whereas there
  is not in the said Act any Provision authorising such Justice or
  Justices to mitigate the Penalties thereby incurred, or enabling
  the Party to appeal from any Conviction by or Judgement of such
  Justice or Justices: And whereas divers Books and Papers have
  since been printed by several Persons, who, through Inadvertency
  or Mistake, have neglected to comply with the Provisions of the
  said Act, and such Persons have thereby become liable to be sued
  and prosecuted for Penalties to a vast Amount, although such
  Books and Papers were not of an evil or seditious Tendency:
  And whereas it is expedient to limit the Amount of Penalties
  imposed by the said Act; and to enable Magistrates to mitigate
  the Penalties in such Cases as shall appear to them expedient;
  and also to give the Party, who may be aggrieved by a Conviction
  under such Act, a Power of appealing from the same; be it
  therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
  with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
  and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
  Authority of the same, That nothing in the Twenty-seventh Section
  of the said Act contained shall extend to make any Person
  or Persons offending against the same, liable to more than
  Twenty-five Forfeitures or Penalties for printing or publishing
  or dispersing, or assisting in publishing or dispersing, any
  Number of Copies of one and the same Paper or Book, contrary to
  the said Section of the said Act.

  s. 2. “And be it further enacted, That if any Justice or
  other Magistrate before whom any Person shall be convicted
  of any Offence or Offences against the Provisions of the
  before-mentioned Act shall see Cause to mitigate such Penalty
  or Penalties, it shall be lawful for such Justice or other
  Magistrate to mitigate or lessen the same to any Sum not less
  than Five Pounds, over and above all reasonable Costs and Charges
  expended or incurred in the Prosecution.

  s. 3. “And whereas Doubts have arisen whether the Provisions
  contained in the said Act may not be considered as extending
  to Notes and Post Bills of the Governor and Company of the
  Bank of _England_, and to Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes,
  Bonds, and other Securities for Payment of Money, Bills of
  Lading, Policies of Insurance, Letters of Attorney, Transfers
  or Assignments of Public Stocks, Funds, and other Securities,
  and to Dividend Warrants, Receipts for Money or Goods, Deeds or
  other Instruments, Proceedings in the Courts of Law and Equity,
  and other Inferior Courts, Warrants, Orders, and other Papers,
  printed by the Authority of any Public Board or Public Officer
  in the Execution of the Duties of their respective Offices,
  many of which Securities, Instruments, Proceedings and other
  Matters aforesaid, are usually wholly or in Part printed; be
  it therefore hereby declared and enacted, That nothing in the
  said recited Act or in this Act contained shall extend or be
  construed to extend to require the Name and Residence of the
  Printer to be printed upon any such Bank Note, Bank Post Bill,
  Bill of Exchange, or Promissory Note, or upon any Bond or other
  Security for Payment of Money, or upon any Bill of Lading, Policy
  of Insurance, Letter of Attorney, Deed or Agreement, or upon any
  Transfer or Assignment of any Public Stocks, Funds, or other
  Securities, or upon any Transfer or Assignment of the Stocks of
  any Public Corporation or Company, authorized or sanctioned by
  Act of Parliament, or upon any Dividend Warrant of or for any
  such Public or other Stocks, Funds, or Securities, or upon any
  Receipt for Money or Goods, or upon any Proceeding in any Court
  of Law or Equity, or in any Inferior Court, Warrant, Order, or
  other Papers printed by the Authority of any Public Board or
  Public Officer in the Execution of the Duties of their respective
  Offices, notwithstanding the Whole or any Part of the said
  several Securities, Instruments, Proceedings, Matters, and Things
  aforesaid, shall have been or shall be printed, any Thing herein
  or in the said recited Act contained to the contrary thereof in
  anywise notwithstanding.

  s. 4. “And be it further enacted, That if any Person or Persons
  shall think himself, herself, or themselves aggrieved by any
  Conviction, Judgement, or Determination, of any Justice or
  Justices, relating to any Matter or Thing in the before-mentioned
  Act contained; then and in that Case he, she, or they may appeal
  to the Justices of the Peace at the General Quarter Sessions
  to be holden in and for the County, City, or Place, where such
  Conviction, Judgement, or Determination shall have been made,
  next after the Expiration of Twenty Days from the making thereof,
  first giving Six Days Notice of such Appeal to the Person or
  Persons prosecuting for such Penalty or Penalties; and the said
  Justices shall hear and determine the said Appeal at such General
  Quarter Sessions, or, if they think proper, adjourn the Hearing
  thereof until the next General Quarter Sessions to be holden for
  such County, Town, or Place; and the said Justices may, in like
  Manner, if they see cause, mitigate any Penalty or Penalties, and
  may order any Money to be returned which shall have been paid or
  levied under any Conviction as aforesaid, and may also order and
  award such Costs to be paid by either Party to the other, as they
  shall think and judge reasonable.

  from the First Day of _March_ One thousand eight hundred and
  eleven.”

  said Act specified: And whereas the said Provisions have given
  Occasion to many vexatious Proceedings at the Instance of common
  Informers, and it is expedient to discourage the same: Be it
  therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
  with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
  and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
  Authority of the same, That so much of the said Act as enacts

INDIA PAPER.

This paper, which comes to us from China, is decidedly superior to
any other paper for obtaining fine impressions from engravings. That
which is used as the linings of tea chests is equal in quality to
any, although some of it is coarse, and many persons object to the
colour; a thicker and whiter sort comes over as wrappers for silk;
both these sorts are injured by having been used as packages, but out
of them good pieces may be selected, sufficiently large for octavo
pages, and frequently for quarto. A perfect paper of a large size is
imported in chests of two thousand sheets each. A sheet measures four
feet three inches and one tenth in length, and two feet one inch and
one tenth in width. This paper varies very much in quality, so that
circumspection should be used in making a purchase.

All India paper contains particles of hard matter, like minute
portions of stone, small pieces of the hard stalks of some vegetable,
and lumps of the material from which it is made. Previously to its
being printed on, the whole of it ought to be carefully examined, and
these extraneous matters removed with a sharp knife, otherwise they
will injure the surface of the engraving.

There is a smooth side and a rough side in white India paper, called
by printers the right side and the wrong side: this India paper has
the appearance of having been formed on a smooth surface of metal
or stone, by being laid on with a brush, the rough side having the
semblance of paint applied by an unskilful hand, exhibiting all the
marks of the brush in irregular directions; the other side being flat
and smooth. The smooth side is always used for the impression.

In all cases the best way of damping India paper is to put it, in
separate pieces, into a heap of paper that is in a proper condition
for printing, where after lying a few minutes it will be sufficiently
damp for use. _See_ PAPER.


INK.

Printing Ink is a composition formed of two articles, namely, varnish
and colouring matter.

The Rev. William Beloe, treating of early printed books in his
Anecdotes of Literature, &c., says,--“It must have been immediately
obvious that common writing ink, from its want of substance and
viscosity, could by no means answer the purpose. But it must excite
surprise, and indeed admiration, to perceive how soon the greatest
perfection was attained in this particular. So very soon indeed,
and so effectually, that very nearly at the same period books were
printed at Mentz, at Rome, and at Venice, which may almost defy
the competition of succeeding artists.--The Psalter of Fust and
Guttenburg, at Mentz, the Lactantius of Sweynheym and Pannartz, at
the Subiaco Monastery, and the Pliny of Jenson, at Venice, may be
adduced as specimens of extraordinary beauty, with regard to the
quality of the ink; not perhaps surpassed, or, if at all, in a very
small degree, by the productions of Bodoni at Parma, or the most
perfect examples of the London Presses. It is observable that this
excellence of the ink is particularly apparent in all the early books
printed upon vellum, and in Germany.”

This is strictly true, for the ink has, after a lapse of four hundred
years, preserved its beautiful blackness, as I have myself witnessed,
particularly in the large Bible printed by Faust and Schœffer,
and generally known as the Mentz Bible without Date; but in the
seventeenth century the quality had materially retrograded, and it
was not till the latter part of the eighteenth century that it began
to recover its character, when two or three of our most celebrated
printers set about improving the ink of commerce for some very
expensive splendid works, but the ingredients which they used they
kept a profound secret.

As I believe that I am the only person who has written a practical
work on the subject, I will give an extract from the preface of my
work on Printing Ink, which will show the state in which this article
was at that time.

“The process of making printing ink has never yet been treated of
fully by any practical man, either printer or manufacturer, so that
this work will come before the public on a subject as new as it is
important.

“This assertion may perhaps appear to require some modification, as
the following pages will present to the reader many receipts for
making printing ink, by preceding authors; but when it is known
that this subject is only treated of incidentally by some, and that
others of them were not professionally printers, and therefore could
scarcely be expected to know what was the desideratum, much less to
attain it, we shall have little cause to wonder that all have failed.
That they have failed, admits of no question: a long experience in
the art of printing in all its branches enables and obliges me to
say, that ink made from any one of these receipts could not be used
in any printing office in the metropolis.

“Moxon, who wrote the first practical work on printing, gives a
detailed method of preparing printing ink after the Dutch manner,
which he highly praises; yet this ink would be deemed worthless at
present, and although as good as the succeeding ones, he is never
quoted on this subject; yet when types are treated of, his name
appears in every subsequent work on printing. I believe few printers
know his book, the title of which is, “Mechanick Exercises: or, the
Doctrine of Handy-works. Applied to the Art of Printing. By Joseph
Moxon, Member of the Royal Society, and Hydrographer to the King’s
Most Excellent Majesty.” 2 vols. 4to. 1677, and which has served as
the foundation of subsequent works on printing.

“M. le Breton, printer to the King of France, is the next author
on this subject. He wrote the article on Printing in the French
Encyclopédie, of which the method of making printing ink forms a
part. He is continually quoted by succeeding writers, yet his ink
would not rank higher than Moxon’s in a printing office.

“J. B. Papillon, a celebrated French engraver on wood, published a
treatise on that subject, in which he gave a detailed account of
making printing ink, which would not be in greater estimation than
Moxon’s and Breton’s.

“Lewis, in his Philosophical Commerce of Arts, relates the results of
many experiments on boiling oil, which are of little practical use,
and gives the process of making ink from Breton.

“Nicholson, in his Dictionary of Chemistry, gives some passages which
purport nothing, and then proceeds to a loose description of the
process from Lewis.

“The Messrs. Aikin, in their Dictionary of Chemistry, give a short
vague article on the subject, quoting Lewis as their authority.

“Rees’s Cyclopædia contains an article on the subject from Lewis.

“The Printer’s Manual, a French work, published in 1817, gives an
account of the process, founded on Breton’s formula.

“The Encyclopædia Britannica is the only work to my knowledge which
has broken through the trammels of obsolete authorities, and given a
receipt by which a printing ink might be made that could be used; but
the editor candidly acknowledges that the article produced would be
of an inferior quality.--It is, however, the only real approximation
to the knowledge of making an ink that could be worked with; and
yet it is deficient in specifying the qualities of the different
materials, and also of their due proportions, so that it would not
produce a clean working ink, nor an ink of a good colour.

“The information given in the book is not theoretical, but deduced
from my own practice; and there is not an article mentioned in the
whole treatise but what I have repeatedly employed, nor a receipt
given but what has undergone the strictest ordeal--that of being
used in the regular way of business. The fine black ink has been
pronounced by some of our first printers unrivalled; and the ink for
general purposes has been allowed, by the most competent judges, to
be fully equal to the high priced inks of the principal manufacturers.

“I have used them myself, and also superintended their use by others
to the extent of thousands of impressions printed consecutively,
without having found occasion to wash or clean the form or engraving,
and this in producing fine work. I am, through this experience,
enabled to assert, that I do not think it possible that inks could
be produced that would work cleaner or more freely, produce finer
impressions, and retain their freshness of colour without imparting
stain to the paper, than the inks, both black and coloured, the
receipts of which I have published in this work.

“The Society for the Encouragement of Arts showed their sense of my
success in this pursuit, by awarding to me their large medal, and a
sum of money, for my imitation of drawings printed from engravings on
wood with inks of my own preparing; and by an invitation to furnish
them with a paper on the preparation of printing ink.

“Knowledge of such a subject as this on which I am treating, must,
to possess any value, be practical, not theoretical: without being
so, there would not exist a possibility of accurately knowing the
imperfections existing in the inks, of estimating the errors and
deficiencies, and, least of all, of providing a remedy. Thirty-six
years practice in the metropolis, with some previous ones in the
country, spent in executing the most common as well as the most
splendid works, may perhaps entitle me to feel competency to my
undertaking, and encourage the belief of it in others.

“To printers generally, I feel that this work will be of great
service, judging from the absolute want of information on the
subject, a want that I have experienced in a very high degree during
my practice. It will enable every printer to prepare a good ink
himself, and to have it always of an uniform quality;--it will enable
him to prepare the finest ink without any risk or danger;--it will
enable him to prepare coloured ink of any hue at half an hour’s
notice, that will work as clean as black ink, when any fancy work is
required;--it will enable him to print bankers’ cheques, &c. with a
changeable ink, to prevent fraudulent alterations:--it is in fact
opening a door to the extension of the powers of the printing press
which has hitherto been closed and sealed.”

This was written in 1832, and contains as faithful an account of
the state of knowledge as could be acquired at that time on this
subject; for the few manufacturers of the article then existing most
scrupulously guarded the secret of its preparation, and no really
fine ink could be purchased. The publication of my work on Decorative
Printing, and of this work on Printing Ink, has effected a great
revolution in the art; for previously it was impossible, even in the
metropolis, to have any thing printed in a superior way except with
black ink, whereas now, there is hardly a printer who would not feel
ashamed to avow that he could not execute work in any colour whatever
in the same style of workmanship as with black ink. For the method of
preparing the different inks, both black and of every colour, with
the ingredients and their proportions, I must refer the reader to the
book itself.

For the qualities requisite in the best printing ink, _see_
ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD, and also FINE PRESSWORK.

By the Act 6 G. 4. c. 111., the Customs Duty on the importation of
ink for printers is 1_l._ 1_s._ the cwt.


INK BLOCK.

The block on which the ink is spread to supply the balls; in wooden
presses, it is nailed to the upper near hind rail, and is supported
at the bottom by a stay fastened to the lower rail.

It was generally made of a piece of elm wood, between two and three
inches thick, with a ledge of fir wood at the back, at one end, and
also at part of the front. A quantity of ink was kept in the farther
corner, which was rubbed out on the bottom with the brayer, from
which it was taken with a ball, and then distributed.

In fine printing that required strong ink, it being found very
difficult, in cold weather, to distribute the ink properly, some
offices adopted a small table having an iron plate for the top, with
a shelf under it for a lamp, which warmed the ink and caused it to
work more freely.

The introduction of rollers has superseded the use of the ink block,
for which has been substituted an inking apparatus, which see.


INKING APPARATUS.

The substitution of rollers for balls required a different apparatus
for the taking of ink.

Mr. Edward Cowper, of the late firm of Applegath and Cowper, claims
the invention of the first apparatus, for which the firm took out
a patent. Mr. Cowper kindly favoured me with drawings, and the
following description, in the year 1818.

“The apparatus consists of an inking roller, a distributing table,
and an ink trough.

“The inking roller is made of wood covered with the elastic
composition, [treacle and glue,] it is about three inches diameter
and eighteen or twenty inches long, according to the length of the
form; it is furnished with two handles which are fixed to the spindle
on which the roller turns; the spindle passes through the roller so
that when one handle is moved the other is moved also; the handles
stand over the roller at right angles to it, this position being
from practice found most convenient; a small leg projects from one
of the handles, which prevents them from falling on the table and
becoming soiled.

“The distributing table is of wood covered with a sheet of lead as
level as possible; and the frame on which it stands is of cast iron.

“The ink trough is fixed at one edge of the table, and is composed
of a metal roller, turned true, and a thin plate of steel, the edge
of the plate presses against the metal roller by means of levers and
weights, the ink is placed between the steel plate and the metal
roller.

“When the metal roller is turned round it becomes covered with
a film of ink, the inking roller is then dabbed against it, and
rolled backwards and forwards on the distributing table in different
directions; it is then passed two or three times over the form.

“The advantages of this mode of inking are considerable; it is much
easier to use than the balls, produces better work, and saves in
balls and ink not less than five shillings per week. Its peculiar
recommendation is the great regularity of colour which may be
obtained, and the delicate manner in which the letter is touched,
advantages which render it applicable to the finest specimens of
typography.”

[Illustration: Inking apparatus]

The following account is extracted from Hansard’s “Typographia.”

“A more simple and cheap apparatus for this purpose was immediately
got up by Mr. Foster, the inventor of the composition balls. It is a
stand having its two legs and feet of cast-iron; and its top, upon
which the ink is distributed, instead of lead, as in the former
apparatus just described, is mahogany. Behind this, elevated about
two inches, is the stage for taking the ink on to the roller. At
either end of the stage is a recess for receiving the contrivance
which contains the ink. This is similar in shape to the brayer
formerly used; but turned hollow, with the handle and top to screw
on; at the bottom are holes, and when the ink is wanted on the
stage, the workman, taking hold of this bottle-brayer, moves it
from one recess to the other, drawing it slowly along the stage. In
this movement the ink, by its own gravity, will issue out from the
holes at the bottom, and leave a portion on the stage, more or less,
according to the rapidity or frequency of its transit. [_See figure_,
p. 421.]

“Mr. Arding soon improved upon Foster’s apparatus, by making the
ink-stage of cast-iron, with circular recesses; and the whole table
more of a solid form; both makers now adopt the same pattern: but the
bottle-brayer has not been found to answer, as the ink soon clogs up
the holes, and the wood is liable to be split by the screw at the
top; and an old servant of the press-room, the common brayer, has
again been found the most effective for this purpose.

[Illustration: Inking apparatus]

“I have had several of these inking tables at work, and find a
decided preference due to the last described. The mahogany surface
seems more congenial to the temperament of the ink and roller, than
either the lead or iron. The ink is taken better, and distributes
better. A line of colour is taken as perfectly from the stage as
from a cylinder, since the roller, being cylindrical, can only touch
the ink in a line, and it is only giving the roller a portion of a
revolution on the stage to make it take a greater quantity of colour
if necessary. More of the flue and dirt, inseparable from the working
of paper, is held by the wood than by the lead; and consequently, the
roller keeps cleaner, and the forme works better. The table is easily
washed by the lye-brush, and no further waste of ink is occasioned.

“This apparatus has been further improved by substituting a box and
cylinder for the stage and brayer. The advantage of which will be,
that the quantity of ink on the cylinder to come in contact with the
roller, is regulated by a pressure at the top, out of the body of the
ink, instead of at the bottom against which the ink must rest.

[Illustration: Inking apparatus]

“The cylinder is of mahogany, and, as here shown, moves in a box
or trough which contains the ink; and which has a lid moving on
hinges coming nearly over the top of the cylinder. To the under
edge of this top is nailed a slip of thick butt or sole leather.
This, by its naturally elastic quality, will always press upon the
cylinder according as the lid is more or less tightly screwed down
by thumb-screws. This leather will also intercept in its way any
filth which may arise from the depôt of ink before it can reach the
cylinder: and which, when accumulated, may, by unscrewing the lid and
throwing it open, as in the figure, be instantly scraped away with
one stroke of the knife; and no further waste of the ink incurred. No
part of the ink in this apparatus is exposed when the lid is down:
and only a very small portion of the cylinder at the time of working.”

A wooden table after the pattern of Foster’s apparatus is now
generally used, the top is covered with lead on which the ink is
distributed on the rollers; the stage on which the ink is taken is
not raised more than about a quarter of an inch, and at the two back
corners are two recesses, one for the supply of ink, and the other
for the brayer, when not in use. _See_ ROLLERS.


INNER FORM.

The form that has the second page in it; it is always worked before
the outer form, except there be some particular reason to the
contrary. _See_ LAY ON.


INNER TYMPAN.

A frame covered with parchment, which fits into the outer tympan;
two flat points slip under the head-band of the outer tympan, which
secure that end in its place; and the sides are kept down by two
hooks on each side of the outer tympan which turn into eyes screwed
into the sides of the inner tympan; in iron presses the hooks turn
round studs, under the heads.


IN PAGE. _See_ OUT PAGE.


INSERTION.

If the compositor have left out words or lines, the corrector inserts
it, and makes this mark ‸ where it is left out, which is called the
mark for insertion.--_M._ This is now called an “Out;” an insertion
is when the author makes any addition in the proof sent to him.


INSET.

The same as offcut: with printers it is called an offcut; when the
work comes into the hands of the bookbinder, and the sheets are
folded, it then becomes an inset, being inserted in the middle of the
sheet, to complete the regular succession of pages.


INSIDE QUIRES.

The regular and perfect quires of paper, of twenty-four good sheets
each; they are thus designated to distinguish them from the outside
or corded quires.

IRISH.

“Mr. Innes, in his Essay on the Antiquities of Scotland and Ireland,
delivers it as his opinion, that the _Beth Louis Nion_, or alphabet
of the Irish, was nothing but an invention of the Irish Seanachies,
who, since they received the use of Letters, put the Latin alphabet
into a new arbitrary order, and assigned to each letter a name of
some _Tree_; and that this was not a genuine alphabet of the Irish in
ancient times, or peculiar to them; but was a bare inversion of the
Latin alphabet.

“Colonel Vallancey, (in his Irish Grammar,) gives three different
alphabets of the Irish language, which vary from each other in
name, order, and number; the first consists of twenty-five letters,
the second of twenty-six, and the last of seventeen. As for the
Irish letters being different in power from those of other nations,
it must be observed, that the powers of letters differ in every
language, and the mode of pronouncing the same letters is various in
different countries: the Irish characters are said to be of Asiatic
original--granted.--But they appear to have been transmitted to the
inhabitants of that country from those who had adopted the Roman
letters.

“It is singular, but it is no less true, that the Norman characters
were generally used in England from the coming of William the First,
and that the Saxon characters were intirely disused in the very
beginning of the twelfth century; but the Irish and Scots preserved
the ancient forms of their characters till the end of the sixteenth
century.”--_Astle._

The most ancient grammar of the Irish language now extant, is the
_Uraiceact na Neigeas_, or Primer of the Bards, written by _Forchern_
some few years before our vulgar æra, transcribed and illustrated by
_Ceannfaolidh na foghlama_, or _Kinfaolidh_ the learned, an author
of the seventh century. The alphabet, according to this author, was
originally named _bobel_, _loth_, &c. from the names of certain
masters who assisted in composing the Japhetan language soon after
the confusion of tongues.

As the Grecians gave the name of alphabet to the table of their
letters from the two initial letters, Alpha, Beta; and the Latins
called their table Abcdarium from their three first letters, A, B, C.
So the Irish gave the name of Bobel, Loth, to their ancient elements,
from the two first letters B, L; and to their more modern alphabet,
that of Bethluisnon, from B, L, N, which proves that N did formerly
possess the third place; whereas in the present alphabet it takes up
the fifth. The last and most modern name of the Irish alphabet, in
conformity to the Abcdarium of the Romans, is Abgiter.

It is remarkable in all the Irish alphabets, (except the modern one,
the order of which is copied from the Roman, and introduced since
Christianity,) that the vowels follow each other; an instance not
known in any other language, yet the labials, dentals and linguals,
are intermixed without order.

Of these letters, the five last are diphthongs. Q, Ng, Z, are
reckoned superfluous consonants, and are thrown out of the modern
alphabet, so that the remaining letters are only 17, which compose
the abgitur or alphabet now in use, and are placed in order as the
Latin abcdarium.

The ancient grammarians called the alphabet _Faoidh_, or _Faodh_,
i.e. a a voice, a sound or language; because such letters are
expressive of the voice and language. The moderns, to support
their hypothesis, have corrupted this word to _Feadh_, a wood; and
from hence have denominated the letters after certain trees, three
of which they are at a loss to expound. According to Neuman, the
Hebrew letters do each separately signify the idea either of motion,
space, or matter; hence each Hebrew word is at once a name, and a
definition of the subject, and all objects in the natural and moral
world must be known as soon as their names are known, and their
separate letters considered. The proper names of men being borrowed
from such ideas as _Adam_, i.e. red earth, it is more rational to
suppose our learned ancestors named their letters according to
Forchern, from men, rather than from trees.--_A Grammar of the
Iberno-Celtic, or Irish Language._ By _Major Charles Vallancey._

The vowels are five in number, _a_, _o_, _u_, _e_, _i_, whereof the
three first, a, o, u, are broad, and the two last, _e_, _i_, are
narrow.

In words of two or more syllables, regard must be had to the
correspondence of the vowels, for when the _last_ vowel of the former
syllable is a broad vowel, the first vowel of the following syllable
must be broad also; and when in some _latter_ syllable the vowel is
small, the last of the immediately preceding must be _small_ also.
Example, _du-ne_, a man, is false orthography, because the last
syllable ending in a _small_ vowel, the first must end in a _small_
one also, as _dui-ne_.

No vowel is ever to be doubled as _ee_, _oo_, &c. in the same
syllable.

The diphthongs, or union of two vowels, are thirteen.

                          Example.

Vallancey, by omitting the letter R, reduces the modern alphabet to
seventeen letters; Connellan, by admitting this letter, increases it
to eighteen.

ITS OWN PAPER.

When one, two, three, or more copies of a sheet of a work, or a job,
are printed on the paper that the whole is intended to be worked on,
it is said to be _Pulled on its own Paper_. This is frequently done
at the commencement of a work, when a proof of the first sheet is
sent to the author, or bookseller, or both; that they may see the
effect produced before it is proceeded with.




J.


JEFF. _See_ THROW.


JOB.

Any thing which printed does not exceed a sheet, is termed a Job,
and is paid for extra to the compositor, because there is no return
of furniture or of letter: he has generally to put up fresh cases,
and has some additional trouble in getting the right letter, and in
making up the furniture. _See_ SCALE OF PRICES.


JOB HOUSE.

A printing office, the general run of business in which is the
printing of Jobs; namely, cards, shop bills, bills for articles
stolen, or lost, play bills, lottery bills, large posting bills,
and all other things of a similar description. These houses seldom
execute book work to any extent, as their materials, particularly
with respect to types, are not calculated for it; and few houses
undertake both kinds of work to any great degree. The principal job
houses in London have a variety of types, both as to size and shape,
such as few or no book houses ever think of laying in; consequently
they are enabled to execute such work in a style superior to that
in which a book house could, with regard to producing effect, and,
in general, more expeditiously. Jobbing is an extensive business in
London. _See_ BOOK HOUSE.


JOHNSON, RICHARD. _See_ DONATIONS.


JOIN.

When two or more compositors are employed on the same piece of
work, and one of them composes all his copy, so that there is no
intervening matter between his copy and that in the hands of another
of the companions who has followed him, he says, he has joined, or,
he has set up close. Also, if a compositor be on a piece of work
without a companion, and from any cause he be obliged to suspend
composing one part of his copy, and to proceed with a succeeding
part; then, when he has been enabled to compose this intervening
part, and has got it completed, he says, he has joined, or, he has
joined his matter.


JOINTS.

Tympan joints, and frisket joints.--_M._


JUSTIFIERS. _See_ QUOTATION QUADRATS.


JUSTIFYING.

Spacing a line out so that it fits with a proper degree of tightness
in the measure of the composing stick;--placing a wood cut in
a page, and filling up the vacancies with leads, scaleboards,
quadrats, quotations, or furniture, so that when the form is locked
up, the wood cut shall be fast, and the lines above and below it
even;--fixing any other matter in a similar way in a page.--With
pressmen, putting cards into the head of a wooden press, and screwing
it up until the pull be proper, is termed _Justifying the Head_, or _
Justifying the Pull_. _See_ HARD PULL.


JUSTIFYING THE HEAD. This amounts to the same thing as justifying the
pull, which see.


JUSTIFYING LINKS. _See_ COMPOSING.


JUSTIFY THE PULL.

Putting additional cards into the mortises of the cheeks of a press,
or taking some out, as the case may require, in order to regulate
the pull: for a small light form, the pressure requires to be
comparatively slight; but for a large, solid form of small letters,
it requires a heavy soaking pull to do justice to the work; in this
case, additional cards are put into the mortises of the head. This
refers only to the wooden press; for justifying the pull of iron
presses, _see_ under the respective articles.


JUSTIFY A STICK;

viz. a composing stick. Screwing the slides of his composing stick to
the measure wanted--_M._




K.


KEEP IN,

is a caution either given to, or resolved on, by the compositor, when
there may be doubt of driving out his matter beyond his counting off:
wherefore he sets close, to Keep in.--_M._


KEEP OUT,

is a caution either given to, or resolved on, by the compositor, when
there may be doubt of getting in his matter too fast for his counting
off: wherefore he sets wide, to drive or keep out.--_M._ This term is
not now used; we say Drive out, which see.


KERN.

Kerned letters are such as have part of their face hanging over one
side or both sides of their shanks.--_M._


KEY.

A flat square hook, with a handle to put the fingers through in a
transverse direction to the hook. Its use is to lift the forms out of
the lye trough, after having brushed off the ink from the types, the
furniture, and the chase.


KNOCK UP.

In the warehouse, is to place the sheets of each signature of a work
uniformly even at the edges upon each other, after they are taken
down from the poles, and previously to their being piled away.

The person who has this to do, takes a quantity of about two quires,
(if it be a stout hard paper he may take a little more,) and holding
it loosely at the edges with both hands, he bends the ends a little
towards him, so that the paper shall form a curve; he then lifts it
up a little from the table, and lets it drop upon its edge through
his hands,--the curve giving the edge a little firmness, many of the
sheets drop down into their places; he repeats this two or three
times, and will then, in letting it drop upon the table, bring the
lower part nearer to him, so that the outside of the curve may strike
first, and throw the sheets gradually up higher at the back; this he
will also do two or three times; he then lets the further side rest
upon the table, and shuffles the upper sheets gradually away from
him, lifting the whole up, and letting the edges drop upon the table,
three or four times; repeating these operations soon brings all the
edges even, both at the ends and sides; he then lays this taking on
one side, and repeats the operation with other takings, laying them
on each other, till he has completed the whole.

A soft flimsy paper takes more time in knocking up than a hard paper,
as the sheets have not strength enough separately to be driven into
their places by striking on the edges.


KNOCK UP BALLS.

To knock up balls is the term used for making balls: it is to cut the
pelts to a proper size; to fill them with a proper quantity of wool;
to nail them to the ball stocks; to trim them; and to put them into a
working condition. _See_ BALLS.


KNOCK UP A LETTER.

It sometimes happens with old letter, that a letter may be worn so
low that it will not print well in a page; the workman then takes
that letter out of the form, and holds the shank of it upon the side
of the chase, and with the head of the shooting stick beats lightly
upon the foot of the shank, till he have battered metal enough out
of the shank, to raise it higher against paper; if it prove too high
against paper, he rubs the bottom of the shank upon the side of the
chase, to rub it down. This operation seldom happens, unless another
of the same sort of letter is wanting, and hard to come by: for else
the compositor will bow the letter, and pop it into a waste box in
his case, where he puts all naughty letters, that he may not be
troubled with them another time.--_M._ _See_ BOW THE LETTER.


KOOFEE,

Kufic, Cufic, Cuphic, or Oriental. Ancient Arabic; it was called
Cuphic, from the town of Couphah, built on the Euphrates. _See_
ARABIC.




L.


LATIN.

The Latin alphabet is the same as the English, with the exception
of the W, which “is a letter unknown, as to form and place, in
the alphabets of the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and Goths.
This letter is peculiar to the northern languages and people, and
particularly to the nations who are of Teutonic and Sclavonic
original.”--_Astle._

For the allowance of the duty on paper used in the printing of
books in the Latin language within the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, the universities of Scotland, and the university of
Trinity College, Dublin, _see_ PAPER.

“_The modes of quoting the Civil and Canon Laws._--The INSTITUTIONS
are contained in four Books: each Book is divided into Titles; and
each Title into paragraphs; of which the first, described by the
Letters _pr._ or _princip._ is not numbered. The DIGESTS or PANDECTS
are in fifty Books: each Book is distributed into Titles; each Title
into Laws; and, very frequently, Laws into Paragraphs, of which the
first is not numbered. The CODE is comprised in twelve Books: each
of which is divided, like the Digests, into Titles and Laws; and,
sometimes, Laws into Paragraphs. The NOVELS are distinguished by
their Number, Chapter, and Paragraph.

“The old way of quoting was much more troublesome, by only mentioning
the Number, or initial Words, of the Paragraph or Law, without
expressing the number either of Book or Title. Thus, § _si adversus,
12 Inst, de Nuptiis_, means the 12th Paragraph of the Title in the
Institutions _de Nuptiis_, which Paragraph begins with the Words _si
adversus_; and which a modern Civilian would cite thus, I. 1. 10. 12.
So _l._ 30 _D. de R. J._ signifies the 30th Law of the Title in the
Digests _de Regulis Juris_: according to the modern way thus, D. 50.
17. 30. Again, _l._ 5. § 3. _ff. de Jurejur_. means the 3d Paragraph
of the 5th Law of the Title in the Digests de Jurejurando: better
thus, D. 12. 2. 5. 3. And here note, that the Digests are sometimes
referred to, as in the last instance, by a double f; and at other
times by the Greek Π or π.

“The method of quoting the ROMAN CANON LAW is as follows. The DECREE,
as said above, consists of three Parts; of which the first contains
101 Distinctions, each Distinction being subdivided into Canons:
thus, 1 _dist. c. 3. Lex_ (or 1 _d. Lex_) is the first Distinction,
and 3d Canon, beginning with the word _Lex_. The second part of
the Decree contains 36 Causes; each Cause comprehending several
Questions, and each Question several Canons: thus 3. _qu. 9. c.
2. Caveant_ is Cause the 3d, Question the 9th, and Canon the 2d,
beginning with _Caveant_. The third part of the Decree contains 5
Distinctions, and is quoted as the first part, with the addition
of the words _de Consecratione_; thus, _de Consecr. dist. 2. can.
Quia corpus_ (or, _can. Quia corpus 35. dist. 2. d. Consecr._)
means the 2d Distinction, and the 35th Canon of the Treatise _de
Consecratione_, which Canon begins with _Quia corpus_.

“The DECRETALS are in three Parts; of which the first contains
Gregory’s Decretals in 5 Books; each Book being divided into Titles,
and each Title into Chapters: and these are cited by the name of the
title, and the number of the chapter, with the addition of the word
_Extra_, or the capital letter X: thus, _c. 3. Extra de Usuris_;
is the 3d Chapter of the Title in Gregory’s Decretals, which is
inscribed _de Usuris_; which Title, by looking into the Index, is
found to be the 19th of the 5th Book. Thus also, _c. cum contingat.
36 X. de Offic. & Pot. Jud. Del._ is the 36th Chapter, beginning
with _Cum contingat_ of the Title, in Gregory’s Decretals, which is
inscribed _de Officio et Potestate Judicis Delegati_; and which, by
consulting the Index, we find is the 29th Title of the 1st Book. The
Sixth Decretal, and the Clementine Constitutions, each consisting
of _5_ Books, are quoted in the same manner as Gregory’s Decretals;
only, instead of _Extra_ or _X_, there is subjoined _in sexto_ or in
_6_, and _in Clementinis_ or _in Clem._ according as either part is
referred to: thus, _c. Si gratiose 5 de Rescrip. in 6_, is the _5_th
Chapter, beginning with _Si gratiose_, of the Title _de Rescriptis_,
in the _6_th Decretal; the Title so inscribed being the 3d of the 1st
Book: and Clem. 1. de Sent. et Re Judic. (or, _de Sent. et R. J. ut
calumniis, in Clem._) (or, _c. ut calumniis 1. de Sent. et R. J. in
Clem._) is the first Chapter of the Clementine Constitutions, under
the Title _de Sententiâ et Re Judicatâ_; which Chapter begins with
_Ut calumniis_, and belongs to the xith Title of the 2d Book.

“The EXTRAVAGANTS of John the 22d are contained in one Book,
divided into 14 Titles: thus, _Extravag. Ad Conditorem, Joh. 22. de
V. S._ means the Chapter, beginning with _Ad Conditorem_, of the
Extravagants of John 22d; Title, _de Verborum Significationibus_.
Lastly, the Extravagants of later Popes are called _Communes_, being
distributed into 5 Books, and these again into Titles and Chapters:
thus _Extravag. Commun. c. Salvator. de Præbend._ is the Chapter
beginning with _Salvator_, among the _Extravagantes Communes_; Title,
_de Præbendis._”--_Bibliotheca Legum._ See Dr. Hallifax’s Analysis of
the Roman Civil Law, and Butler’s Horæ Juridicæ Subsecivæ.


LAY DOWN.

To arrange the pages of a sheet, or of a half sheet upon the imposing
stone in their proper order, and to take the page papers from under
them. _See_ IMPOSING.

In the warehouse this term is used to denote the placing of the
printed sheets of a work upon the gathering table in their proper
order, for the purpose of gathering them together into complete books.

When a long number has been printed, the warehouseman generally lays
down a bundle only of each signature, that the heaps may not be too
high for the boys to reach the top sheet in gathering.

The first sheet in the gathering is laid down at the extreme end of
the table at the left hand, and the succeeding sheets follow to the
right in regular order, with the signature to the front of the table.
The person who lays them down should run the signature page over in
each heap to see that they all lie the same way, and have not been
turned in knocking up, or piling away, which, when it happens, and
passes undiscovered, causes a great deal of trouble in collating.
_See_ GATHERING.


LAY LETTER.

The _Laying of Letter_, or, _To lay Letter_, is the putting of new
types into cases, in their proper situations.

When a new fount of types has to be laid, the first consideration
is, are there new cases for it, or are there any spare cases in the
house, or are there any that can be appropriated to it; and, how many
pairs are to be occupied with it? If it be for a work to be done by
a companionship, each compositor takes his proportionate share, and
lays the letter for his own use: or, it may be an addition to a fount
already in work; in which case also each takes his share, as it is
looked on as more advantageous to lay letter than to distribute,
particularly if it be of a small size. After having put the letter
into the cases, and set it up as close as possible, there will be
found many superabundant sorts; these are put into a pair of fount
cases, and the compositors generally make their cases even, that is,
take out their superfluous sorts. If the fount cases will not contain
all the sorts, the remainder are put into coffins, and placed in a
basket or a letter box; if there should not be any fount cases, then
all the spare sorts are put into coffins. The overseer should then be
informed of the state of the fount, so that the house may cast up to
the surplus sorts, if thought necessary.

I would not advise the laying of many pairs of cases with a moderate
sized fount, as an additional pair or two can be easily made at any
time.

Where the letter founder has tied up in one piece more than one sort,
I would recommend the compositor to put the piece upon a galley, or
he will mix the sorts, and give himself and the house unnecessary
trouble in his proof; using a composing rule will save him trouble.


LAY ON.

A phrase used for the number of books to be printed. Thus they say,
There is 1000, 2000, 3000, &c. Laid on.--_M._ We also use the phrase,
but without any regard to number; as, such a press is going to lay a
form on--such a press has laid a form on--What form shall we lay on?

It is usual, when a work is printed in sheets, to take the inner form
first; the only motive, to my knowledge, for this custom is, that,
where there are many presses at work, it prevents the pressmen taking
advantage of each other, by those who are first off choosing the form
that has the least difficulty in working. An old reason assigned
for this practice is, that it is advantageous to the bookbinders
in beating the book, preparatory to binding it; as the indentions
of the types face each other, and are more easily made smooth; but
the indentions would face each other equally if the usual order of
working the forms were reversed. When there are wood cuts in one
form, and none in the other, then the form without cuts should be
worked first; as working the cuts last prevents the indention of the
types appearing on the engraving, which would otherwise necessarily
take place to its prejudice.

The term is also used in printing at machines, where a boy lays a
sheet on a board, or on a travelling web, in order to its being
conveyed round the cylinders to be printed.


LAY IN SHEETS.

When the pressman lays sheets on the tympan, it is stiled _Laying in
Sheets_.--_M._ The term is now obsolete.


LAY OUT SHEETS.

When the pressman takes sheets off the tympan, and lays them on the
heap, it is stiled _Laying out Sheets_.--_M._ Obsolete.


LAY-UP.

Before the letter of a worked-off form is distributed, or before it
is cleared away, if the work be finished it is unlocked upon a board
laid in the trough, and well rinsed with water, while the compositor
keeps working the pages backward and forward with his hands, and
continues pouring water on them till the lye and ink are washed away,
and the water runs off clear: this is termed laying-up.

The board should always be washed clean on its upper side before the
form is laid upon it.


LEADERS.

Between the ends of the lines and the figures of reference, in
indexes, contents, in many tables, and accounts, are placed,
sometimes full points, sometimes hyphens, metal rules, or dotted
quadrats; all these, without distinction, are termed _Leaders_. Full
points with a sufficient space between them, or dotted quadrats, are
now generally used, being looked upon as neater than hyphens or metal
rules.


LEADS.

These articles are called leads by printers, and space lines by type
founders. _See_ SPACE LINES.


LEAN. _See_ BEAT LEAN.--_M._


LEAN FACE.

A letter whose stems and other strokes have not their full
width.--_M._ As now understood, a letter of slender proportions
compared to its height.--_See_ TYPES.


LECTURES.

  5 & 6 W. 4. c. 65. “An act for preventing the Publication of
  Lectures without Consent.

  delivering the same, or to any Lecture or Lectures delivered in
  any University or public School or College, or on any public
  Foundation, or by any Individual in virtue of or according to any
  Gift, Endowment, or Foundation; and that the Law relating thereto
  shall remain the same as if this Act had not been passed.”


LETTER BOARD.

In Moxon’s time both the letter board and the paper board were
made alike, similar to the present paper board; and he strongly
recommended to have the board made of one piece, without a joint:
they are now different from each other. The letter board is made of
two deals, about an inch thick, and the smallest size allows a demy
chase to lie upon it without hanging over the edges; the deals are
joined together on the under side by two dovetailed tapering tongues
inserted into dovetailed tapering grooves, the contrary way to each
other; and these tongues project below the bottom, so as to serve as
feet for the board, to a depth rather more than equal to the height
of letter, and allow the board to be placed upon a bulk, or upon
another letter board, upon which pages or small jobs are placed,
without the bottom of the board touching the face of the type. If the
boards shrink, or the joint opens, the aperture can be immediately
closed up again, by striking the edges with a mallet, and driving the
tongues up tight.

The usual sizes of letter boards in a printing office are Demy and
Royal; but when works on larger paper are printed, it is necessary to
have boards of a corresponding size. The Demy boards are 26 inches by
22; the Royal 30 inches by 26.


LETTER BRUSH.

A brush used in composing rooms, something like a polishing brush for
shoes, but not quite so large; with which to brush dust off forms
before they are taken to the proof press to have a proof pulled, and
before they are taken into the press room to be worked. Every press
ought also to have one, that if any dust, or particles of dirt, get
upon the face of the letter, they may be brushed off.


LETTER FOUNDERS.

  By the Act of the 39th of George 3. cap. 79. s. 25. it is
  enacted, “That from and after the Expiration of Forty Days after
  the passing of this Act, every Person carrying on the Business of
  a Letter Founder, or Maker or Seller of Types for Printing, or
  of Printing Presses, shall cause Notice of his or her Intention
  to carry on such Business to be delivered to the Clerk of the
  Peace of the County, Stewartry, Riding, Division, City, Borough,
  Town, or Place, where such Person shall propose to carry on such
  Business, or his Deputy, in the Form prescribed in the Schedule
  to this Act annexed; and such Clerk of the Peace, or his Deputy,
  shall, and he is hereby authorized and required thereupon to
  grant a Certificate in the Form also prescribed in the said
  Schedule, for which such Clerk of the Peace, or his Deputy,
  shall receive a Fee of One Shilling, and no more, and shall file
  such Notice, and transmit an attested Copy thereof to one of his
  Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State; and every Person who
  shall, after the Expiration of the said Forty Days, carry on such
  Business, or make or sell any Type for Printing, or Printing
  Press, without having given such Notice, and obtained such
  Certificate, shall forfeit and lose the Sum of Twenty Pounds.”

  s. 26. “And be it further enacted, That every Person who shall
  sell Types for Printing, or Printing Presses, as aforesaid, shall
  keep a fair Account in Writing of all Persons to whom any such
  Types or Presses shall be sold, and shall produce such Accounts
  to any Justice of the Peace who shall require the same; and if
  such Person shall neglect to keep such Account, or shall refuse
  to produce the same to any such Justice, on Demand in Writing to
  inspect the same, such Person shall forfeit and lose, for such
  Offence, the Sum of Twenty Pounds.” _See_ CERTIFICATE.

LETTER HANGS.

If the compositor has been careless in emptying his composing stick,
so as to set the letter loosely down in the galley, and they stand
not perfectly square and upright, the _Letter Hangs_: or if after
overrunning on the correcting stone he has not set his letter in a
square position again, before he locks up (for we may suppose when
the pages are opened the letter stands loose, and more or less out of
square), so then, the matter standing thus out of square, is said to
_Hang_.--_M._


LIBELS,

  _blasphemous and seditious_. Act 60 Geo. 3. cap. 8.--_For the
  more effectual Prevention and Punishment of Blasphemous and
  Seditious Libels._

  Commences by declaring that it is expedient to make more
  effectual provision for the punishment of blasphemous and
  seditious libels; and then proceeds to enact, “That from and
  after the passing of the Act, in every Case in which any Verdict
  or Judgment by default shall be had against any Person for
  composing, printing, or publishing any blasphemous Libel, or any
  seditious Libel, tending to bring into hatred or contempt the
  Person of His Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or the Regent,
  or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom as by
  Law established, or either House of Parliament, or to excite His
  Majesty’s Subjects to attempt the Alteration of any Matter in
  Church or State as by Law established, otherwise than by lawful
  Means, it shall be lawful for the Judge, or the Court before whom
  or in which such Verdict shall have been given, or the Court in
  which such Judgment by default shall be had, to make an Order
  for the Seizure and carrying away and detaining in safe Custody,
  in such Manner as shall be directed in such Order, all Copies
  of the Libel which shall be in the Possession of the Person
  against whom such Verdict or Judgment shall have been had, or
  in the Possession of any other Person named in the Order for
  his Use; Evidence upon Oath having been previously given to the
  Satisfaction of such Court or Judge, that a Copy or Copies of
  the said Libel is or are in the Possession of such other Person
  for the Use of the Person against whom such Verdict or Judgment
  shall have been had as aforesaid; and in every such Case it shall
  be lawful for any Justice of the Peace, or for any Constable
  or other Peace-officer acting under any such Order, or for any
  Person or Persons acting with or in aid of any such Justice of
  the Peace, Constable, or other Peace-officer, to search for any
  Copies of such Libel in any House, Building, or other Place
  whatsoever belonging to the Person against whom any such Verdict
  or Judgment shall have been had, or to any other Person so named,
  in whose Possession any Copies of any such Libel, belonging to
  the Person against whom any such Verdict or Judgment shall have
  been had, shall be; and in case Admission shall be refused or not
  obtained within a reasonable Time after it shall have been first
  demanded, to enter by force by Day into any such House, Building,
  or Place whatsoever, and to carry away all Copies of the Libel
  there found, and to detain the same in safe Custody until the
  same shall be restored under the Provisions of this Act, or
  disposed of according to any further Order made in relation
  thereto.

  s. 2. “That if in any such Case as aforesaid Judgment shall be
  arrested, or if, after Judgment shall have been entered, the
  same shall be reversed upon any Writ of Error, all Copies so
  seized shall be forthwith returned to the Person or Persons from
  whom the same shall have been so taken as aforesaid, free of all
  Charge and Expence, and without the Payment of any Fees whatever;
  and in every Case in which final Judgment shall be entered upon
  the Verdict so found against the Person or Persons charged with
  having composed, printed, or published such Libel, then all
  Copies so seized shall be disposed of as the Court in which such
  Judgment shall be given shall order and direct.

  s. 3. “Provided that in Scotland, in every Case in which any
  Person or Persons shall be found Guilty before the Court of
  Justiciary, of composing, printing, or publishing any blasphemous
  or seditious Libel, or where Sentence of Fugitation shall have
  been pronounced against any Person or Persons, in consequence
  of their failing to appear to answer to any Indictment charging
  them with having composed, printed, or published any such Libel,
  then and in either of such Cases, it shall and may be lawful for
  the said Court to make an Order for the Seizure, carrying away,
  and detaining in safe Custody, all Copies of the Libel in the
  Possession of any such Person or Persons, or in the Possession of
  any other Person or Persons named in such Order, for his or their
  Use, Evidence upon Oath having been previously given to the
  Satisfaction of such Court or Judge, that a Copy or Copies of the
  said Libel is or are in the Possession of such other Person for
  the Use of the Person against whom such Verdict or Judgment shall
  have been had as aforesaid; and every such Order so made shall
  and may be carried into effect, in such and the same Manner as
  any Order made by the Court of Justiciary, or any Circuit Court
  of Justiciary, may be carried into effect according to the Law
  and Practice of Scotland: Provided always, that in the Event of
  any Person or Persons being reponed against any such Sentence of
  Fugitation, and being thereafter acquitted, all Copies so seized
  shall be forthwith returned to the Person or Persons from whom
  the same shall have been so taken as aforesaid; and in all other
  Cases, the Copies so seized shall be disposed of in such Manner
  as the said Court may direct.

  s. 4. “That if any Person shall be legally convicted of having,
  after the passing of this Act, composed, printed, or published
  any blasphemous Libel, or any such seditious Libel as aforesaid,
  and shall, after being so convicted, offend a second Time, and
  be thereof legally convicted before any Commission of Oyer
  and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or in His Majesty’s Court of
  King’s-bench, such Person may, on such second Conviction, be
  adjudged, at the Discretion of the Court, either to suffer such
  Punishment as may now by Law be inflicted in Cases of high
  Misdemeanors, or to be banished from the United Kingdom, and all
  other Parts of His Majesty’s Dominions, for such Term of Years as
  the Court in which such Conviction shall take place shall order.

  s. 5. “That in case any Person so sentenced and ordered to be
  banished as aforesaid, shall not depart from this United Kingdom
  within Thirty Days after the pronouncing of such Sentence and
  Order as aforesaid, for the Purpose of going into such Banishment
  as aforesaid, it shall and may be lawful to and for His Majesty
  to convey such Person to such Parts out of the Dominions of His
  said Majesty, as His Majesty by and with the Advice of his Privy
  Council shall direct.

  s. 6. “That if any Offender, who shall be so ordered by any such
  Court as aforesaid to be banished in manner aforesaid shall,
  after the End of Forty Days from the Time such Sentence and
  Order hath been pronounced, be at large within any Part of the
  United Kingdom, or any other Part of His Majesty’s Dominions,
  without some lawful Cause, before the Expiration of the Term for
  which such Offender shall have been so ordered to be banished as
  aforesaid, every such Offender being so at large as aforesaid,
  being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be transported to such
  Place as shall be appointed by His Majesty for any Term not
  exceeding Fourteen Years; and such Offender may be tried, either
  before any Justices of Assize, Oyer and Terminer, Great Sessions,
  or Gaol Delivery, for the County, City, Liberty, Borough, or
  Place where such Offender shall be apprehended and taken, or
  where he or she was sentenced to Banishment; and the Clerk of
  Assize, Clerk of the Peace, or other Clerk or Officer of the
  Court having the Custody of the Records where such Order of
  Banishment shall have been made, shall, when thereunto required
  on His Majesty’s Behalf, make out and give a Certificate in
  Writing, signed by him, containing the Effect and Substance only
  (omitting the formal Part) of every Indictment and Conviction of
  such Offender, and of the Order for his or her Banishment, to
  the Justices of Assize, Oyer and Terminer, Great Sessions, or
  Gaol Delivery, where such Offender shall be indicted, for which
  Certificate Six Shillings and Eight Pence, and no more, shall
  be paid, and which Certificate shall be sufficient Proof of the
  Conviction and Order for Banishment of any such Offender.”

  The remaining clauses relate to the mode of proceeding in case of
  former conviction, limitation of actions, &c.

  11 G. 4. & 1 W. 4. c. 73. “An act to repeal so much of an Act of
  the Sixtieth Year of His late Majesty King _George_ the Third,
  for the more effectual Prevention and Punishment of blasphemous
  and seditious Libels, as relates to the Sentence of Banishment
  for the Second Offence; and to provide some further Remedy
  against the Abuse of publishing Libels.

  “Whereas by an Act passed in the Sixtieth Year of the Reign of
  His late Majesty King _George_ the Third, intituled _An Act for
  the more effectual Prevention and Punishment of blasphemous
  and seditious Libels_, it was amongst other things enacted,
  that if any Person should, after the passing of that Act, be
  legally convicted of having composed, printed, or published any
  blasphemous Libel or any such seditious Libel as in the said
  Act is before mentioned, and should after being so convicted
  offend a second Time, and be thereof legally convicted before
  any Commission of Oyer and Terminer, or Gaol Delivery, or in
  His Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench, such Person might on such
  second Conviction be adjudged, at the Discretion of the Court,
  either to suffer such Punishment as might by Law be inflicted in
  Cases of high Misdemeanour, or to be banished from the United
  Kingdom and all other Parts of His Majesty’s Dominions for such
  Term of Years as the Court in which such Conviction should take
  place should order: And whereas it is expedient to repeal so
  much of the said Act as relates to the Sentence of Banishment
  for the Second Offence; Be it therefore enacted by the King’s
  most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of
  the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present
  Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That so
  much and such Parts of the said Act as relate to the Sentence
  of Banishment for the Second Offence be and the same is hereby
  wholly repealed.”

It hath been ruled that the finding a libel on a bookseller’s shelf
is a publication of it by the bookseller; and that it is no excuse
to say that the servant took it into the shop without the master’s
knowledge; for the law presumes the master to be acquainted with what
the servant does. _Rex v. Dodd, 1 Sess. Cas. 33._--_Burn’s Justice
of the Peace, vol. 3, p. 292, Art._ LIBEL. _See_ PUBLICATIONS,
PERIODICAL.


LICENCE. _See_ PRINTING.


LIFT.

When a work is nearly completed, and perfect copies are required
before the whole number can be worked off at press, it is customary
when all the matter has been composed, and there is not convenience
to lay every form on at a different press, to print short numbers
of each, in order to make perfect books as soon as possible; thus,
if there be 3000 copies of a work printing, 250 of each of the few
last sheets may be worked, and when the pressmen have printed this
number of one form and taken it off the press for the purpose of
laying on another form, it is said they lift, or, they have lifted.
This frequently takes place in periodical works, such as magazines,
reviews, &c.; and also occasionally when a superior proof is wanted,
or two or three copies of any thing particular are required, that
will not admit of waiting till a press is off with its regular
number: in these latter instances, the pressmen endeavour to pull
them without the tympans, with a few sheets of proof paper over the
form, that they may not disturb their overlays and making ready; and
they mark the quoins which secured their form on the press, that they
may replace it exactly in its situation with as little waste of time
and paper as possible.

In the warehouse, each separate portion of printed paper, whether it
consists of five or six sheets or more, that is placed upon the poles
to dry, is termed a lift.


LIGATURES.

Two or more letters joined together, and cast on the same shank, are
in a printing office called _Ligatures_.

The ligatures now used are few in number, having been reduced to
æ, ﬀ, ﬃ, ﬄ, ﬁ, ﬂ, and œ; within the last thirty years we had, in
addition, ct, as also ſb, ſh, ſi, ſk, ſl, ſſ, and ſt, which are now
discarded, in consequence of our confining ourselves entirely to the
s. In the leaf of an old book, _De vita & gestis Scanderbegi_, now
lying before me, there are the following additional ones,--_as_,
_at_, _cta_, _et_, _es_, _ius_, _is_, _ij_, _iu_, _ll_, _ns_, _st_,
_ſs_, _ſp_, _ta_, and _us_.

I do not think it was an improvement to change the shape of the &,
which, till the alteration, was really a ligature, being _e_ and _t_
joined together; the modern character has no meaning in it, neither
the Roman & nor the Italic _&_.

Earl Stanhope proposed to abolish the present ligatures, by making
the f more upright without being kerned, so as to admit an i, an l,
or another f after it, and to introduce other ligatures, or, as he
termed them, ‘logotypes,’ that more frequently occur, viz. th, in,
an, re, se, to, of, and on.

Smith, in his Printer’s Grammar, says that Mr. Caslon introduced the
ſb and the ſk.--_See_ BILL, LOGOTYPE.

LITERAL ERRORS.

By literal errors in printing, are understood the mistakes of the
compositors in single letters only, viz. the taking up a wrong
letter, or inverting a right letter; the term is never applied to
either outs or doubles.


LITERARY PROPERTY.

The Libraries which are entitled to claim copies of new publications
under the act of 6 & 7 W. 4. c. 110. are--

1. The King’s Library, since transferred to the British Museum.

2. The Library of the University of Oxford, commonly called the
Bodleian.

3. The Library of the University of Cambridge.

4. The Library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh.

5. The Library of the College of the Holy Trinity in Dublin.

The two English Universities have the following privileges:--

1. The copyright in all works bequeathed to, or acquired by them, is
vested in them in perpetuity, so long as the works are printed at
their own presses.

2. They have (in common with the King’s Printers in England,
Scotland, and Ireland,) the exclusive privilege of printing Bibles
and Prayer Books; and an exemption from the duty on paper used for
them.

[The Bibles and Prayer Books printed in Scotland and Ireland, are not
allowed to be sold in England.]

3. They have the same privilege (in common with the King’s Printer in
England) of printing the Statutes of the Realm.

4. They have an exemption from the duty on paper used in books for
the purposes of classical instruction, and in all works in the
learned languages, printed at their presses.

5. They have 500_l._ per annum paid to each of them by the nation,
for the purpose of enabling them to assist poor scholars and fellows
in printing their works.

The four Universities of Scotland, and Trinity College, Dublin, have
the same advantage with respect to the perpetuity of their copyrights
as the English Universities have.--(The printing of Bibles and Prayer
Books, in both these countries, appears to be exclusively the right
of the King’s Printer.) They have also an exemption from the duty on
paper used in all works of classical instruction, and in the learned
languages, printed at their presses.--The Scotch Universities do not
appear to have ever made use of this privilege in the manner that
Oxford and Cambridge have done; but by naming some individual as
_Printer to the University_, have communicated to him the advantage
derived from it.


LOCKING UP.

The tightening of the quoins round a form with the mallet and
shooting stick, to enable the compositor to lift it from the imposing
stone, and that it may be moved about without the types or the
furniture being displaced by such moving; as also that the form may
be secure when working at press, so that the types do not draw out
with beating. _See_ IMPOSING.


LOGOTYPE.

Two, or more, letters cast in one piece. There have been several
attempts to introduce such short words, terminations, and prefixes,
as are of frequent occurrence, cast in one piece, but they have never
succeeded. _See_ LIGATURES.


LONG CROSS.

The cross that divides the chase the longest way; it is also the
narrowest.


LONG PRIMER.

The name of a type, one size larger than Bourgeois, and one smaller
than Small Pica. _See_ TYPES.


LONG PULL. _See_ EASY PULL.--_M._


LOOSE JUSTIFYING.--_M._

To space a line or lines in a composing stick so that they shall not
be tight; also to place wood cuts, or any other matter, in a page, so
that they shall not be fast when locked up.

  Foreign and other illegal Lotteries.

  “Whereas the Laws in force are insufficient to prevent the
  advertising of Foreign and other illegal Lotteries in this
  Kingdom, and it is expedient to make further Provision for that
  Purpose: Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent
  Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords
  Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament
  assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after
  the passing of this Act, if any Person shall print or publish,
  or cause to be printed or published, any Advertisement or other
  Notice of or relating to the drawing or intended drawing of any
  Foreign Lottery, or of any Lottery or Lotteries not authorized by
  some Act or Acts of Parliament, or if any Person shall print or
  publish, or cause to be printed or published, any Advertisement
  or other Notice of or for the Sale of any Ticket or Tickets,
  Chance or Chances, or of any Share or Shares of any Ticket or
  Tickets, Chance or Chances of or in any such Lottery or Lotteries
  as aforesaid, or any Advertisement or Notice concerning or in
  any Manner relating to any such Lottery or Lotteries, or any
  Ticket, Chance, or Share, Tickets, Chances, or Shares thereof or
  therein, every Person so offending shall for every such Offence
  forfeit the Sum of Fifty Pounds, to be recovered, with full
  Costs of Suit, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information
  in any of His Majesty’s Courts of Record in _Westminster_ or
  _Dublin_ respectively, or in the Court of Session in _Scotland_;
  one Moiety thereof to the use of His Majesty, His Heirs and
  Successors, and the other Moiety thereof to the Use of the Person
  who shall inform or sue for the same.”


LOW CASE.

When the compositor has composed almost all his letters out of his
case, he says his _Case is Low_.--_M._


LOWER CASE.

The case in which the small letters of an alphabet, the spaces, and
quadrats are laid; it is placed upon the frame immediately below the
fore edge of the upper case. _See_ CASE.


LUG.

When balls stick together in distributing they are said to lug; they
then diffuse the ink more equally and thinly on the surface, and make
better work: they also retain on their surface particles of dust, or
other small substances, and do not part with them to the letter in
the form, which is a great advantage. Composition Balls, when too
soft, will lug so much in distributing as to tear the composition
and spoil the ball; when this is the case, they require to be placed
in a dry situation for a short time, and exposed to a draught of
air, which evaporates the superfluous moisture, and brings them into
good condition; when time cannot be allowed for this mode of cure,
sponging the surface with spirits of turpentine will promote the
evaporation, and be of great service. _See_ FLARING BALLS.


LYE.

The lye used for the purpose of cleaning a form is a solution of
alkali in water; it ought to be made of the best pearl ash. The usual
proportion is one pound of pearl ash to a gallon of soft water; it
should be stirred up with a stick till the alkali dissolves, which
soon takes place. It is generally kept in a large jar, with a cover
to it, which some master printers lock; but more frequently the cover
is loose for the pressmen to have free access to it; the cover should
however be kept on, to prevent dust and dirt getting into the jar.

If hard water be used, it will require a greater quantity of pearl
ash; as the acid in the water will combine with some of the alkali to
neutralise it, which of course will have the effect of making the lye
weaker than if soft water, with which there is no such combination,
had been used.

An intelligent pressman once informed me, that in the country he had
frequently made lye, by boiling together a peck of wood ashes and
nearly a quarter of a peck of quicklime, in a pailful and a half of
soft water, and afterwards straining the decoction for use.

This is, in fact, soap lye, which is made caustic by the quicklime:
lye from the soap boilers has indeed of late years been used by
many master printers in the metropolis; but it requires to be kept
constantly covered in order to exclude the air, which, when the lye
is exposed, combines with it and renders it mild, thus destroying its
power. I have always found that this lye affects the hands and makes
them sore, as if chapped, when washed in it to take off ink.

In the choice of pearl ash the following table, from Vauquelin, may
be found useful, which shows all the substances contained in six
kinds of potash.

  +------------------------+------+--------+-------+---------+----------+
  |                        |      |Sulphate|Muriate|         | Carbonic |

  | 1152 of American Potash|  857 |   154  |   20  |     2   | 119=1152 |

  | 1152 of Vosges Potash  |  444 |   148  |  510  |    34   | 304=1152 |
  +------------------------+------+--------+-------+---------+----------+

There is evidently an error in this statement as to the component
parts of the last article, the Vosges potash, which appears to be
with respect to the quantity of the muriate of potash; but the table
shows that the American potash is by far the best, and the Dantzic
potash the worst of the six analysed.

The following observations from _Kirwan on Manures_, may also be
serviceable, particularly to printers who are so situated as to find
it necessary to make their lye from the ashes of vegetables.

“Alkaline salts are of great importance in several arts, the
proportion of ashes afforded by different vegetables, and that of
alkali by the ashes of each sort of vegetable, has been accurately
attended to: the following are the best authenticated results of the
experiments made with this view.

“One thousand pounds of the following vegetables, perfectly dry, and
burned in a clean chimney and open fire, afforded the quantity of
ashes, and saline matter, exhibited in the annexed tables.

Thus though fumitory gives the greatest weight of saline product from
a given weight of the dry vegetable, yet from a given weight of ashes
wormwood produces above double the weight of saline matter.

In Yorkshire the women use the ashes of the ash tree to make a lye to
scour their pewter dishes and plates, in preference to the ashes of
any other wood; as this is the result of experience, I should be led
to suppose that they contain a great proportional quantity of pearl
ash.


LYE BRUSH.

The brush used with lye to remove the ink that adheres to the types,
the furniture, and the chase, after a form has been worked off, as
also after proofs have been pulled. It is about nine or ten inches
long by three inches broad, and the hairs are nearly two inches long.


LYE TROUGH.

The lye trough is square and shallow, lined with lead, and its upper
edge is bound with iron to preserve it from injury, which would
otherwise arise from concussion when a form is lifted into it; there
is also a loose board laid in it for the protection of the bottom. It
is suspended on a frame by two centres, as here represented.

[Illustration: Lye trough]

There is always some lye kept in this trough; and when a form has
been worked off, it is laid in it, and the ink is brushed from the
face of the letter, the furniture, and chase with the lye, previous
to rinsing it with water. It is usually made capable of containing a
royal chase.

MACHINES.

Cylindrical printing, or, as it is generally termed, Machine
printing, is a new mode of obtaining impressions from types, the
introduction of which took place in the year 1814. It has caused a
great revolution in the art, from the facilities which it affords
for printing sheets of paper of a size of which no press worked by
manual labour is capable, nor, were it capable, is the strength of
one man equal to the exertion requisite for the pressure necessary
to produce a respectable impression. In addition to this advantage
of printing sheets of such larger dimensions, it possesses the power
of multiplying impressions so rapidly as to appear like the work of
magic. This may seem hyperbolical; but the average rate of working
at a press for common work, that is the general run of book work,
with two men, one to ink the types, and the other to work the press,
is but 250 copies an hour, while a machine will produce 1,250 copies
in the same time; and considerably more might be obtained, were
not its powers restrained by the limited human means of feeding it
with paper, it being found by experience that the number stated is
the extent to which one person could supply it, he having regard to
laying on the sheets evenly, so as to preserve a regular margin: but
this speed was not deemed sufficient to meet the wants that were
felt, and the Times newspaper is now printed at a machine where
the paper is laid on at four places, one form of which, consisting
of four pages, is printed at the astonishing rate of 4,320 an hour
at its ordinary rate of working, a fact which I have seen and
ascertained myself, by counting its motions with a seconds watch in
my hand. Mr. Richard Taylor has also a similar Machine at which the
Weekly Dispatch is printed. Considering what has been done, I cannot
see a reason why the paper should not be supplied at six or eight
places, if found necessary, so as to increase the number printed to
6,000 or 8,000 in an hour; as the wonder ceases when we remember that
steam is the moving power. Of the comparative merits of the Machine
and the Press I shall speak subsequently.

As the details of the invention are not generally known, I will give
some account of them, letting the parties speak for themselves, so
far as I have been able to procure their own statements. The first
is the Specification of the Patent granted to Mr. William Nicholson;
the next, Observations on the Art of Printing Books, &c., written by
him, and published in his own Journal, which clearly describe the
present machines and inking apparatus. This specification, and the
other details, with the engravings, will render it unnecessary for
me to enter into a lengthened description of these machines, or do
more than merely state that the form is imposed in the usual manner,
laid upon a horizontal table, which travels under a cylinder covered
with woollen cloth, adjusted so as to have a proper bearing upon
the types in order to produce an impression, and that the inking
apparatus is at one end, consisting of small rollers, which take and
distribute ink upon another table, for each impression, when the form
in travelling passes under one of them to receive its coating of ink.

  “Specification of the Patent granted to Mr. William Nicholson, of
  New North-Street, Red Lion-Square; for a Machine or Instrument
  for printing on Paper, Linen, Cotton, Woollen, and other
  Articles, in a more neat, cheap, and accurate Manner, than is
  effected by the Machines now in use. Dated April 29, 1790.

  “To all to whom these presents shall come, &c. Now know ye that,
  in compliance with the said proviso, I the said William Nicholson
  do hereby declare, that my said invention is described in the
  plan hereunto annexed, and the description thereof hereunder
  written, and in manner following; that is to say, my invention
  consists in three parts or particulars; namely, first, the
  manner or method of making, preparing, or placing, the original
  model, models, casts, types, engravings, carvings, or sculptures
  from which the impression is to be made. Secondly, in applying
  the ink, or colouring-matter, to such models, casts, types,
  engravings, carvings, or sculptures. And, thirdly, in taking off
  the impression, or transferring the ink, or colouring-matter,
  from such models, casts, types, engravings, carvings, or
  sculptures, to the paper, cloth, or other material upon which it
  is intended it should remain.

  “I. In the first place then, I not only avail myself of all the
  methods of making, preparing, and placing, the original models,
  casts, types, engravings, carvings, or sculptures which have
  hitherto been known or used in printing, and do myself make use
  of them in conjunction with my newly-invented method of applying
  the ink, or colouring-matter, to such original models, casts,
  types, engravings, carvings, or sculptures, and also with my
  newly-invented method of taking off the impressions, but I do
  likewise make, put together, and arrange them in a new manner, as
  occasion may require; that is to say,

  “II. I make my moulds, punches, and matrices, for casting
  letters, in the same manner, and with the same materials, as
  other letter-founders do, excepting that, instead of leaving
  a space in the mould for the stem of one letter only, I leave
  spaces for two, three, or more letters, to be cast at one pouring
  of the metal; and at the lower extremity of each of those spaces
  (which communicate by a common groove at top) I place a matrix,
  or piece of copper with the letter punched upon its face in the
  usual way. And moreover, I bring the stem of my letters to a due
  form and finish, not only by rubbing it on a stone, and scraping
  it when arranged in the finishing-stick, but likewise by scraping
  it on one or more sides, in a finishing-stick whose hollowed part
  is less deep at the inner than the outer side. I call that side
  of the groove which is nearest the face of the disposed letter,
  the outer side; and the purpose accomplished by this method of
  scraping is, that of rendering the tail of the letter gradually
  smaller the more remote it is, or farther from the face. Such
  letter may be firmly imposed upon a cylindrical surface, in the
  same manner as common letter is imposed upon a flat stone. I
  specify and affirm that the above described methods of casting
  two or more letters at once, and of chamfering or sloping their
  tails, are parts of my new invention.

  “III. I impose or dispose my letter for printing in the common
  manner, to be used in conjunction with my newly-invented
  improvements. And I likewise impose it in frames or chases
  adapted to the surface of a cylinder of wood, or metal, and
  fasten it to the said surface by screws, or wedges, or in
  grooves, or by other methods well known to workmen; and this
  imposing letter upon a cylinder I state and affirm to be part of
  my new invention.

  “IV. I cut, carve, engrave, chase, cast, model or make, (in the
  usual manner of performing those operations,) blocks, forms,
  plates, types, or originals, to be used for printing, either of
  wood, metal, or other materials; and these I use in conjunction
  with my other newly-invented improvements. I likewise, for other
  kinds of work, do fasten with glue, cement, screws, wedges,
  or by other known methods, such blocks, forms, plates, types,
  or originals, as aforesaid, to the surface of a cylinder. I
  likewise, for other kinds of work, do cut, carve, engrave, chase,
  cast, model or make, blocks, forms, plates, types, or originals,
  as aforesaid, of a cylindrical form, of wood, metal, or other
  materials. And I state and affirm that this disposition of
  blocks, forms, plates, types, or originals, upon a cylinder, and
  also that the cutting, carving, engraving, chasing and casting,
  modelling or making, blocks, plates, types, or originals, of a
  cylindrical form, as aforesaid, are parts of my new invention.

  “V. In the second place, I distribute or apply the ink, or
  colouring-matter, upon the surface, or in the interstices, of
  the blocks, forms, plates, types, or originals aforesaid, by
  causing the surface of a cylinder, smeared or wetted with the
  colouring-matter, to roll over, or successively apply itself
  to, the surfaces of the said blocks, forms, plates, types, or
  originals, of whatever figure or construction such blocks, forms,
  plates, types, or originals, may be. Or else I cause the said
  blocks, forms, plates, types, or originals, successively to apply
  themselves to the said cylinder. I call the said smeared or
  wetted cylinder, the colouring-cylinder. Its surface is covered
  with leather, or the dressed skins which printers call pelts,
  or else it is covered with woollen, or linen, or cotton cloth.
  When the colour to be used is thin, as in calico-printing, and in
  almost every case, the covering is supported by a firm elastic
  stuffing, consisting of hair, or wool, or woollen cloth wrapped
  one or more folds round the cylinder. When the covering consists
  of woollen cloth, the stuffing must be defended by leather, or
  oilskin, to prevent its imbibing too much colour, and by that
  means losing its elasticity. It is absolutely necessary that the
  colouring-matter be evenly distributed over the surface of the
  cylinder; for this purpose, when the colour is thick and stiff,
  as in letter-press printing, I apply two, three, or more small
  cylinders, called distributing-rollers, longitudinally against
  the colouring-cylinders, so that they may be turned by the motion
  of the latter; and the effect of this application is, that every
  lump or mass of colour which may be redundant, or irregularly
  placed upon the face of the colouring-cylinder, will be pressed,
  spread, and partly taken up, and carried by the small rollers
  to the other parts of the colouring-cylinder; so that this last
  will very speedily acquire and preserve an even face of colour.
  But if the colouring-matter be thinner, I do not apply more than
  one or two of these distributing rollers; and, if it be very
  thin, I apply an even blunt edge of metal, or wood, or other
  material, or a straight brush, or both of these last, against
  the colouring-cylinder, for the purpose of rendering its colour
  uniform.

  “VI. When I apply colour to an engraved plate, or cylinder,
  or apply the colour through the interstices of a perforated
  pattern, or cylinder, as in the manufacturing of some kinds
  of paper-hangings and floor-cloths, I use a cylinder entirely
  covered with hair or bristles, in the manner of a brush.

  “VII. The whole of the manipulations or practices described in
  the two preceding paragraphs (numbers V. and VI.) are parts of my
  invention.

  “VIII. In the third place, I perform all my impressions by the
  action of a cylinder or cylindrical surface; that is to say,
  I cause the paper, or cloth, or other material intended to be
  printed upon, (and previously damped if necessary,) to pass
  between two cylinders, or segments of cylinders, in equal motion;
  one of which has the block, form, plate, assemblage of types, or
  originals, attached to, or forming part of, its surface, and the
  other is faced with cloth or leather, and serves to press the
  paper, cloth, or other material, as aforesaid, so as to take off
  an impression of the colour previously applied. Or otherwise, I
  cause the block, form, plate, assemblage of types, or originals,
  previously coloured, to pass in close and successive pressure
  or contact with the paper, or cloth, or other material, wrapped
  round a cylinder with woollen. Or otherwise, I cause the last
  mentioned cylinder, with the paper, or cloth, or other material
  wrapped round it, to roll along the face of the block, form,
  plate, assemblage of types, or originals, previously coloured.
  Or otherwise, I cause a cylinder having the block, form, plate,
  assemblage of types, or originals, attached to, or forming
  part of, its surface, to roll along the surface of the paper,
  cloth, or other material intended to be printed, and previously
  spread out upon an even plane covered with cloth or leather;
  the said cylinder being supplied with colour by means of a
  colouring-cylinder herein before described, and herein after more
  particularly to be noticed.

  “IX. The foregoing description shews the nature of my invention;
  which may be applied to a great variety of uses, and constructed
  or put together in a great variety of forms. Its uses consist in
  the printing of books in general, the printing of paper-hangings,
  floor-cloths, cottons, linens, woollens, silks, ribands, laces,
  leather, skin, and every other flexible material whatever.
  And its form or construction, being no essential part of the
  invention, may without difficulty be obtained and carried
  into effect, by any workman possessed of common skill and
  ability. Nevertheless, as there may be some artists of such a
  moderate capacity as to find the foregoing instructions not
  sufficient to enable them to construct my machines, I shall
  proceed to exhibit drawings, and describe several methods of
  constructing them. But, at the same time, I think it pertinent
  to take notice, that as the following constructions cannot be
  exclusively claimed by me by virtue of his Majesty’s letters
  patent granted unto me, excepting so far as the same include or
  contain my new improvements and inventions, so, on the other
  hand, I do not exhibit the same as the only practical methods of
  carrying my invention into effect, but I claim the general and
  universal application of the principles discovered and brought
  into practice by me, as before described; and do here proceed
  to exhibit and describe certain specific applications of those
  principles, chiefly from a conviction that it is my duty to
  render this present specification clear and intelligible by
  every means in my power. And moreover, since in the following
  applications or particular methods there are, and may be found,
  several contrivances resulting from a considerable degree of
  deliberation, labour, and expence, and tending to facilitate the
  practice of my said inventions, I do not by any means hereby
  exclude the following descriptions and drawings from my present
  specification; for I do not consider them as being merely
  illustrative of the general principles herein before described
  and explained, but do hereby assert and maintain, that all and
  every parts and part of the machines herein after described,
  which have not hitherto been used as parts of some other machine,
  or in combination directed to the accomplishment of the like
  purpose of printing, are stated and claimed by me as parts of my
  said invention; for the exclusive enjoyment of which, as well
  as of every other part of the said invention hereby specified
  by me, I claim all protection and every advantage which, by his
  Majesty’s letters patent, I may lawfully be entitled to.

  “EXPLANATION OR THE ANNEXED DRAWINGS.

  “Fig. 1. represents a printing-press, more especially applicable
  to the printing of sheets of paper, or books. A. and E. represent
  two cylinders running or turning in a strong frame of wood, of
  metal, or both. The cylinder A. is faced with woollen cloth, and
  is capable of being pressed with more or less force upon HI, by
  means of the lever M. HI is a long table, which is capable of
  moving endways, backwards and forwards, upon the rollers E and
  K. The roller A acts upon this table by means of a cog-wheel,
  or by straps, so as to draw it backwards and forwards by the
  motion of its handle L. The table is kept in the same line by
  grooves on its sides, which contain the cylinder A. D is a chase,
  containing letter set up and imposed. B is a box, containing
  a colouring-roller, with its distributing-rollers CC; it is
  supported by the arm N. O is a cylinder faced with leather, and
  lying across an ink-block; this cylinder is fixed by the middle
  to a bended lever movable on the joint Q.

[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]

  “_The action._ When D, or the letter, is drawn beneath the
  cylinder B, it receives ink; and when it has passed into the
  position R, a workman places or turns down a tympan with paper
  upon it; (this tympan differs in no respect from the usual one,
  except that its hinge opens sideways;) it then proceeds to pass
  under the cylinder A, which presses it successively through its
  whole surface. On the other side, at S, the workman takes off the
  paper, and leaves the tympan up. This motion causes the cylinder
  B to revolve continually, and consequently renders its inked
  surface very uniform, by the action of its distributing-rollers
  CC; and, when the table has passed to its extreme distance in
  the direction now spoken of, the arm G touches the lever P, and
  raises the cylinder O off the ink-block, by which means it dabs
  against one of the distributing-rollers, and gives it a small
  quantity of ink. The returning motion of the table carries the
  letter again under the roller B, which again inks it, and the
  process of printing another sheet goes on as before. N.B. The
  table in this drawing is not quite long enough in its dimensions,
  compared with the inking-roller.

[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]

  “Fig. 2. is another printing-press: in this, B is the
  inking-roller; A is a cylinder, having the letter imposed
  upon its surface; and E is a cylinder, having its uniform
  surface covered with woollen cloth: these three cylinders are
  connected, either by cogs or straps at the edges of each. The
  machine is uniformly turned in one direction by the handle L.
  The workman applies a sheet of paper to the surface of E, where
  it is retained, either by points in the usual manner, or by
  the apparatus to be described in treating of Fig. 4. The paper
  passes between E and A, and receives an impression; after which
  the workman takes it off, and applies another sheet; and in the
  mean time the letter on the surface of A passes round against
  the surface of B, and receives ink during the rotation of B.
  The distributing-rollers CC do their office as in the machine
  Fig. 1.; and once in every revolution the tail F, affixed to B,
  raises the inking-piece G, so as to cause it to touch one of
  the distributing-rollers, and supply it with ink. In this way
  therefore the repeated printing of sheet after sheet goes on.

  “Fig. 3. is a printing-press, more particularly adapted to print
  cottons, silks, paper-hangings, or other articles which run of a
  considerable length.

  “Fig. 4. is a printing-press, chiefly of use for books and
  papers. 1 2 3 4 represents a long table, with ledges on each
  side; so that the two cylinders A and B can run backwards and
  forwards without any side shake. In one of these ledges is
  placed a strip or plate of metal cut into teeth which lock into
  correspondent teeth in each cylinder; by which means the two
  cylinders roll along, without the possibility of changing the
  relative positions of their surfaces at any determinate part of
  the table. This may also be effected by straps, and may indeed
  be accomplished, with tolerable accuracy, by the mere rolling of
  the cylinders on the smooth or flat ledges without any provision.
  A is the printing-cylinder, covered with woollen cloth, and B is
  the inking-cylinder, with its distributing-rollers. The table
  may be divided into four compartments, marked with a thicker
  bounding-line than the rest, and numbered 1 2 3 4. At 1 is
  placed a sheet of paper; at 2 is the form or chase, containing
  letter set and imposed; at 3 is an apparatus for receiving the
  printed sheet; and 4 is employed in no other use than as a place
  of standing for the carriage E, after it has passed through one
  operation, and when it takes ink at F. Its action is as follows:
  the carriage is thrust forward by the workman, and as the roller
  A passes over the space numbered 1, it takes up the sheet of
  paper previously laid there, while the roller B runs over the
  form and inks the letter. The sheet of paper, being wrapped round
  the cylinder A, is pressed against the form as that cylinder
  proceeds, and consequently it receives an impression. When A
  arrives at the space numbered 3, it lets go the sheet of paper,
  while the prominent part of the carriage, G, strikes the lever P,
  and raises the inking-piece, which applies itself against one of
  the distributing-rollers. In this manner therefore the cylinder A
  returns empty, and the cylinder B inked, and in the mean time the
  workman places another sheet of paper ready in the space numbered
  1. Thus it is that the operation proceeds in the printing of one
  sheet after another.

[Illustration: _Fig. 4._]

  “The preceding description is not incumbered with an account
  of the apparatus by which the paper is taken up and laid down.
  This may be done in several ways: Figs. 9 and 10 represent one
  of the methods. D E is a lever, moving on the centre pin C, and
  having its end D pressed upwards by the action of the spring G.
  The shoulder which contains the pin C is fixed in another piece
  F, which is inserted in a groove in the surface of the cylinder
  A; (Fig. 4;) so that it is capable of moving in and out, in a
  direction parallel to the axis of that cylinder. As that cylinder
  proceeds, it meets a pin in the table; which, (letter P, Fig.
  9,) acting on the inclined plane at the other end of the lever,
  throws the whole inwards, in the position represented in Fig. 10;
  in which case the extremity D shoots inwards, and applies itself
  against the side of the cylinder.

[Illustration: _Fig. 9._ _Fig. 10._]

  “In Fig. 11 is a representation of part of the table; the dotted
  square represents a sheet of paper, and the four small shaded
  squares denote holes in the board, with pins standing beside
  them. When the lever DE (Fig. 10) shoots forward, it is situated
  in one of these holes, and advances under the edge of the paper,
  which consequently it presses and retains against the cylinder
  with its extremity D. Nothing more remains to be said respecting
  the taking up, but that the cylinder is provided with two pair
  of these clasps or levers, which are so fixed as to correspond
  with the four holes represented in Fig. 11. It will be easy to
  understand how the paper is deposited in the compartment No.
  3. (Fig. 4.) A pin P, (Fig. 10,) rising out of the platform or
  table, acts against a pin E, projecting sideways out of the
  lever, and must of course draw the slider and its lever to the
  original position; the paper consequently will be let go, and
  its disengagement is rendered certain by an apparatus fixed in
  the compartment numbered 3, (Fig. 4,) of exactly the same kind
  as that upon the cylinder, and which by the action of a pin duly
  placed in the surface of the cylinder A, takes the paper from the
  cylinder in precisely the same manner as that cylinder originally
  took it up in the compartment numbered 1. (Fig. 4.)

[Illustration: _Fig. 11._]

  “Figs. 5, 6, and 7, represent a simpler apparatus for
  accomplishing the same purpose. If A_a_ B_b_ (Fig. 7) be supposed
  to represent a thick plate of metal of a circular form, with two
  pins A and B proceeding sideways or perpendicularly out of its
  plane, and diametrically opposite to each other, and G another
  pin proceeding in the direction of that plane, then it is obvious
  that any force applied to the pin A, so as to press it into the
  position _a_, (by turning the plate on its axis or centre X,)
  will at the same time cause the pin G to acquire the position
  _g_; and, on the other hand, when B is at _b_, or the dotted
  representation of the side-pin, if any pressure be applied to
  restore its original position at B, the pin _g_ will return back
  to G. Now the figures 5 and 6 exhibit an apparatus of this kind,
  applied to the cylinder A; and that cylinder, by rolling over
  the pins P and _p_, properly fixed in the table to re-act upon
  the apparatus, will cause its prominent part G, either to apply
  to the cylinder and clasp the paper, or to rise up and let it
  go. The compartment numbered 3 (Fig. 4) must of course have an
  apparatus of the same kind, to be acted upon by pins from A, in
  order that it may take the paper from that cylinder.

[Illustration: _Fig. 5._ _Fig. 6._ _Fig. 7._]

  “There is one other circumstance belonging to this machine which
  remains to be explained. When the carriage E (Fig. 4) goes out
  in the direction of the numbers 1 2 3 4, both rollers, A and
  B, press the form of letter in their passage; but in their
  return back again the roller A, having no paper upon it, would
  itself become soiled, by taking a faint impression from the
  letter, if it were not prevented from touching it: the manner
  of effecting this may be understood from Fig. 12. The apparatus
  there represented is fixed upon the outside of the carriage E,
  near the lower corner, in the vicinity of the roller A; the whole
  of this projects sideways beyond the ledge of the table, except
  the small truck or wheel B. The irregularly triangular piece,
  which is shaded by the stroke of the pen, carries this wheel,
  and also a catch movable on the axis or pin E. The whole piece
  is movable on the pin A, which connects it to the carriage. C
  D, or the part which is shaded by dotting, is a detent which
  serves to hold the piece down in a certain position. It may be
  observed, that both the detent and the triangular piece are
  furnished each with a claw, which holds in one direction, but
  trips or yields in the other, like the jacks of a harpsicord, or
  resembling certain pieces used in clock and watch making, as is
  clearly represented in the drawing. These claws over-hang the
  side of the table, and their effect is as follows. There is a
  pin C (Fig. 4) between the compartments of the table numbered 2
  and 3, but which is marked F in Fig. 12, where G H represents
  the table. In the outward run of the carriage these claws strike
  that pin, but with no other effect than that they yield for an
  instant, and as instantly resume their original position by
  the action of their respective slender back-springs. When the
  carriage returns, the claw of the detent indeed strikes the pin,
  but with as little effect as before, because its derangement is
  instantly removed by the action of the back-spring of the detent
  itself; but, when the claw of the triangular piece takes the pin,
  the whole piece is made to revolve on its axis or pin A, the
  wheel B is forced down, so as to lift that end of the carriage,
  and the detent, catching on the piece at C, prevents the former
  position from being recovered. The consequence of this is, that
  the carriage runs upon the truck B, (and its correspondent truck
  on the opposite side,) instead of the cylinder A, which is too
  much raised to take the letter, and soil itself; but, as soon as
  the end of the carriage has passed clear of the letter, another
  pin R (Fig. 4) takes the claw of the detent, and draws it off the
  triangular piece; at which instant the cylinder A subsides to its
  usual place, and performs its functions as before. This last pin
  R does not affect the claw of the triangular piece, because it is
  placed too low; and the claw of the detent is made the longest,
  on purpose that it may strike this pin.

  “Lastly, I must take notice, that in these and every other of my
  machines, as well as in every machine whatever, the power may be
  wind, water, steam, animal strength, or any other natural change
  capable of producing motion; and that the mechanism by which
  such powers may be applied to produce a regular unceasing, or an
  intermitting, motion, as circumstances may require, may be used
  with these machines, though I have held it totally unnecessary
  either to specify or annex those methods. The materials, the
  adjustments, the fittings, and that degree of accuracy necessary
  to the perfection of every machine, have likewise made no part
  of my specification, because every workman must know that no
  mechanism can be completed without a due attention to these
  well-known particulars. In witness whereof, &c.”--_Repertory of
  Arts, &c. vol._ v. 1796.


  _“Observations on the Art of Printing Books and Piece Goods by
  the Action of Cylinders._”----Experto credite.

  “We may conceive three ways of delineating figures, or writing.
  The first and most ancient consists in making the traces
  successively by a brush, a pen, or other instrument. This is
  design, painting, or writing. In the latter methods, either the
  whole or the greater part of the figures are made by the action
  or pressure of an original pattern against the material intended
  to be written or painted upon. It is the art of printing. The
  colouring is either deposited from the face of prominent parts
  of the original form, which is usually called a block or type;
  or else it is pressed from cavities cut in the face of the
  original, which in this case is called an engraved plate. Most
  books are printed from original patterns, in relief; and most of
  the imitations of paintings are performed by means of engravings.
  These arts are most frequently distinguished by the names of
  letter-press and copper-plate printing.

  “It can scarcely be matter of new information to those who
  are but moderately acquainted with the state of the Arts, to
  be told that letter-press or book-printing is performed by an
  assemblage of single metallic letters, called types, made of
  lead hardened by an addition of antimony in the metallic state;
  that these letters are composed in the form of book pages, and
  wedged together in iron frames called chases; that the ink is
  a composition of linseed oil and lamp black, of so singular a
  nature, that it will adhere to a ball covered with a pelt or
  sheep’s skin soaked in water, and kneaded to extreme softness
  under the feet, but quits this skin with great readiness to apply
  to the face of the letter when dabbed with the ball; and still
  more, that it almost totally quits the letter to adhere to paper
  rendered semitransparent by soaking in water; or lastly, that the
  paper is applied and pressed against the form of composed letter
  by means of a flat piece of wood urged downwards by a screw.
  These and numerous early discovered principles of this most
  useful art are generally known, and require no more than mere
  recapitulation in this place.

  “The genius of the Chinese language not permitting that people
  to analyse its sounds into an alphabet, as has been done by most
  other nations, has induced them to retain those signs of things,
  and of their correspondent words, which probably constituted the
  first picture or hieroglyphic writings of every rude society.
  Changed and complicated as these may have become by the rapidity
  of transcription, the corruption of ignorance, or whatever other
  causes may have operated through a long succession of ages, they
  still for the most part use words that properly denote things,
  and not sounds. Such words cannot, therefore, be subdivided;
  and it has accordingly been found most convenient, by these
  first possessors of the art, to print from entire blocks, as was
  also done by the first printers in Europe. But our artists soon
  discovered that a few of the simplest characters, namely, the
  letters of the alphabet, would be in many respects more useful,
  as the elements for composing blocks for printers, than a number
  of blocks originally cut for every page of every individual book.

  “Book-printing, therefore, though in fact of the same nature as
  block-printing, has been carried into effect by very different
  machinery from that made use of in the arts which still retain
  the latter method. In book-printing, the heavy metallic form lies
  on a kind of table, and the colour and the paper are successively
  applied to its face: but in block-printing, the block is carried
  and applied to the colour, and afterwards to the work intended to
  be printed. Thus, for example, in the printing of paper-hangings,
  the colour is spread with a brush upon a woollen cloth stretched
  over a surface of parchment or skin evenly supported by a
  half fluid mass of water and mashed paper. To this the block
  is carefully applied by a slight perpendicular stroke or two;
  after which it is applied to the dry paper on a table, and
  pressed against it either by one or more blows with a mallet,
  or by the regular action of a lever. The mechanical part of
  callico-printing is effected nearly in the same manner; but with
  smaller blocks, because of the greater difficulty of making the
  successive fittings on so flexible a material. And in both these
  arts, as well as in book-printing, in red and black, the variety
  of colours are produced by repeated applications of forms or
  blocks, of which the prominent parts are made to fit each other
  according to the nature of the design.

  “In the art of printing from copper-plates, a colour somewhat
  more fluid than for book-printing is made use of. It is pressed
  into the cavities of the plate by smearing it over the surface;
  and by subsequent careful wiping the redundant colour is cleared
  away. In this state, if soaked paper, for which purpose the most
  spongy texture is the best, be strongly pressed against the
  plate, by passing both together between two cylinders of metal or
  hard wood, properly defended by woollen cloth, the greatest part
  of the colour adheres to the paper, and forms what is called a
  print.

  “In all these processes, it is easily seen, that in the
  successive applications of colour, the accurate filling of the
  form or original with the material intended to receive the
  impression, and in various other parts of the manipulation,
  there is much room for the display of skill, or for injury from
  the want of it. It may moreover be collected, that the motions
  attendant on the various steps of manufacture, are in many
  instances difficult to be performed with rapidity and ease,
  until by long continued habit the workman himself is converted
  as it were into a machine. A very slight degree of attention to
  this subject must also shew that, if the originals were of a
  cylindric form, with a contrivance for regularly applying the
  colour and performing the subsequent operations, it would be easy
  to print books and piece goods with a degree of rapidity and
  uniformity, of which the usual method of successive applications
  seems scarcely capable without uncommon care and skill. This
  obvious conclusion has no doubt led to numerous experiments; none
  of which, so far as I can gather, whatever may have been their
  particular utility, have given much promise to supersede the
  ordinary methods. But as the increased demand for the manufacture
  of printed goods has rendered such an improvement an interesting
  object to manufacturers, as well as to those indefatigable
  artists who have directed their efforts towards improvements;
  and as the latter generally take up a new object under a strong
  persuasion that it has not before been pursued by others, it will
  certainly be of advantage to these deserving classes of men, to
  relate a few of the difficulties of this new art.

  “The difficulties attendant on any improvement in the arts may
  be considered either as moral or physical. Under the moral,
  I would class every thing that relates to the prejudices of
  men in favour of the old methods, and their fears of risk,
  together with the œconomical and commercial inconveniencies
  attending the new processes. The physical difficulties are
  such as attend the actual performance of any project after the
  same has been carefully arranged in the mind of the inventor.
  It happens unfortunately here also that the inventor is seldom
  aware of the moral impediments; but almost always concludes,
  that if he can succeed in accomplishing the purpose that he has
  in view, his cares and labour will then be at an end; and that
  the manufacturer, in particular, instead of pointing out new
  impediments discernible only from long continued experience,
  will more readily embrace and approve of the new processes, in
  consequence of his superior knowledge of their intrinsic value.

  “Every good invention appears simple in the prospect, but it
  scarcely ever happens in the execution that the most direct
  road is taken; and in every case there will infallibly be many
  things unknown or unforeseen, which practice only can point out
  as necessary to be done for the complete accomplishment of the
  object in view. Hence, and likewise because few men possessed of
  independent fortune are likely to engage or persevere in a labour
  of this kind, it almost invariably happens that the expences
  exceed the ability of the inventor himself. For these and other
  reasons, new undertakings are generally brought forward by the
  inventor, a man strongly prejudiced in favour of his leading
  pursuit, together with a moneyed friend, who hopes speedily to
  increase his capital from the abilities of the other. It is not
  necessary in this place to describe the usual consequences of a
  partnership, where the minds, the views, and the circumstances of
  both individuals are so very different, and which may be modified
  still more essentially if either of the parties be deficient
  in the common principles required to bind men to each other.
  It is certainly of the highest importance to both, that the
  circumstances of such connections should be very maturely weighed
  before they are entered into.

  “The commercial difficulties or facilities attending any
  invention, are also of great consequence. Every inventor ought
  to enquire not only what has been done before, but likewise into
  the present state of the manufacture he means to improve. In
  this way it is ascertained how small a part the mere press-work
  constitutes in the price of a book. He will find that twelve
  yards of paper-hangings are printed for one penny, in a single
  colour, by hand, which afterwards, by the accumulation of price,
  in paper, colour, duty, and ordinary profit, are sold for three
  shillings; none of which the inventor can pretend to diminish;
  and if he could annihilate the whole labour, his advantage would
  therefore be less than three per cent. without reckoning the cost
  and operation of his machinery. In the callico-printing, with a
  more expensive material, dyeing and field-processes, duty and
  profits of manufacture and vender, the price of laying the block
  will turn out to be an object still less considerable. Again:
  it will be seen that small flat blocks cost but little money in
  comparison with cylinders of sufficient diameter to retain their
  figure, and long enough to apply to the whole breadth of the
  cloth.

  “Under these and other similar points of view, the inventor,
  who may consider the subject in a superficial manner, would be
  ready to abandon his undertaking. But this again ought not to be
  rashly done. It is true, that where the great force of capital
  is employed on objects not comprehended within his project, the
  saving, however large in its absolute amount, or desirable to a
  manufacturer, will scarcely come within the reach of the inventor
  by any bargain he can make short of an actual partnership.
  But it may be possible to separate the respective departments
  of a manufactory. A spinner is not necessarily a weaver; nor
  a printer a linen-draper or a dealer in paper-hangings. The
  several departments of manufacture and commerce are, generally
  speaking, in the hands of acute men, who seldom reason ill with
  regard to the advancement of their peculiar interests; and these
  departments are continually fluctuating in their arrangement,
  as convenience, profit, or the accumulation of capital may
  lead. Experiments are for ever on foot, from day-work to
  piece-work, and from piece-work to the employ of master-workmen
  with others under them, all supported by the capital of the
  large manufacturer, who himself in many instances is the mere
  instrument maintained by the advances or acceptances of the
  warehouseman, the factor, or the merchant. An inventor, who has
  not capital, may seek for employ on the goods or the capital of
  others; and if he has skill to maintain his ground against the
  numerous enterprises which the activity of opposite interests
  will raise against him, he will find that the old order of things
  will readily alter, as soon as an evident interest in favour of
  the new is shewn by actual and continued proofs in the market.

  “Most of the physical difficulties attendant on any new process
  are such as experience only can shew. Thus, in the forging of
  iron by the pressure of rollers instead of hammers, a scheme
  upon which many thousands of pounds have been expended in this
  country, it was apprehended that the more impure parts, which
  are also the most fluid, might be pressed out by the action of
  cylinders, with equal or perhaps more advantage than by that of
  hammers; at the same time that the determinate figure of bars of
  any required size might be given without skill in the operator.
  Experience nevertheless has shewn, that the more fluid part is
  driven out much more effectually by the sudden action of a blow,
  than by the slower compression of a cylinder, which allows time
  for much of the fluid matter to extend itself within the mass.
  Various similar effects present themselves when cylinders for
  printing are substituted instead of planes. Instead of the action
  of dabbing, the colour is usually applied by simple and gradual
  contact, to much less effect; and the impression, though not
  essentially different from that of the block, is performed by a
  gradual action, which affords time for the cloth or paper to fold
  itself in a minute degree into the cavities of the sculpture.
  Hence it is found that the length of paper or cloth printed from
  a cylinder by a definite number of revolutions, will be greater
  or less than another piece manufactured precisely in the same
  way, but with a less or greater degree of pressure. In a block
  this defect is much less, not only from the considerable hold
  it takes upon the surface of the material, but also because the
  error is rectified at every successive application. One of the
  chief difficulties of cylinder printing consists, therefore, in
  the difficulty of laying one colour after another; and this would
  continue to be so even if the materials were not susceptible
  of change, the contrary to which is the fact. There are two
  projects for obviating this. The one consists in confining the
  whole piece to a long table, or to the circumference of a large
  cylinder; and causing the printing cylinder to move, not by the
  successive apposition of its carved surface, but of a bearing
  face regulated by a toothed wheel. The other method consists
  in the use of a frame to confine two or more cylinders, each
  provided with its own toothed wheel, and revolving against a
  large clothed cylinder provided with a suitable wheel to drive
  the others. The piece is caused to pass between the large
  cylinder and the others, in order to receive the impression. With
  regard to the first of these methods, it does not appear easy to
  confine paper, and still less cloth, in such a manner that its
  parts may continue without shift or wrinkle during the action of
  a cylinder, which not being allowed to roll without the check of
  a wheel, must draw the surface either the one way or the other.
  The difficulty of confinement will be very much increased by the
  indispensable requisite that the paper should be afterwards hung
  up to dry, and the callico be carried to the dye-house and the
  bleach-field, between the successive impressions, by which means
  the dimensions of both will be greatly altered. In the second
  method, it is observable that no colours can be printed but such
  as fall clear of each other. In this way, moreover, the gathering
  action of the cylinders may prove very mischievous. For, if we
  suppose the paper or cloth to pass between the great cylinder
  and the first printing roller by an action of the latter which
  tends to make it slip forward on the face of the great cylinder,
  and that when it arrives at the second printing roller it there
  experiences an action of a contrary nature, the consequence will
  be, that the material will become slack between the two rollers,
  and the fittings will be false. Not to dwell on that experience
  which brings forward this obstacle among others, its great
  probability may be deduced from the allowable supposition, that
  the circumference of the first printing cylinder should be one
  thousandth part of an inch too large, and that of the second the
  same quantity too small. For, in this case, the material will
  be shifted one-twentieth of an inch in fifty turns by the first
  cylinder, and the same quantity in the contrary direction by the
  second; a quantity upon the whole quite sufficient to destroy the
  effect of the colours in the progress of one single piece. Such
  minute differences can hardly be avoided in the first instance;
  in addition to which, we may place the varying dimensions of
  the printing cylinder, if not made of metal; and of the great
  clothed cylinder, which in effect has a larger or smaller
  diameter in proportion to the pressure which operates to render
  its elastic covering either thicker or thinner. The only method
  of diminishing these evils seems to be, that all the printing
  cylinders should, by dimension or pressure, or both, be made
  to draw the same way, the outer cylinder most, and the others
  gradually less and less, so that the material should have a
  tendency to apply itself more tightly during its passage through
  the apparatus.

  “The application of the colour to the surface of a cylinder
  block, is attended with some difficulty. An ingenious mechanic
  may contrive various means to produce the action of dabbing, if
  required. When a stuffed cylinder covered with cloth is made
  to revolve in the colour, and thence, after passing a scraper,
  to apply itself to the block cylinder, it is found to be no
  inconsiderable difficulty that its dimensions change, and its
  covering becomes wrinkled by the action of the scraper as well
  as that of the block. A better method, therefore, consists in a
  revolving web of woollen cloth, like a jack towel, stretched over
  three horizontal cylinders parallel to each other, two of which
  support the elastic surface of the web, which in its revolution
  accompanies the block cylinder; and the other serves to guide
  the same web to the colour, or a cylinder revolving in it. This
  method would be very easy and pleasant in its operation, if it
  were not for a property common to all straps which revolve on the
  surface of two or more wheels. These are observed always to seek
  the highest place; so that if a cutler’s wheel were made with a
  groove to carry a strap, instead of a round edge, the strap would
  infallibly mount the ledge, instead of remaining in the groove.
  On this principle, the web would very speedily shift itself to
  one end of the cylinders, if it were not confined sideways, or
  the lower roller were not made considerably thickest in the
  middle, and gradually tapering towards its extremities. This last
  simple expedient is not without its difficulties; but, as I have
  not actually tried it, I shall defer entering into any discussion
  on that head.

  “The running of the paper or piece-goods towards one end of
  the leading cylinder is also one of the greatest difficulties
  attending this method of printing. It is not perfectly removed by
  tapering the leading cylinders.

  “The nature of the trade of paper-staining in this country, which
  requires a large sum to be immediately vested in the payment
  of the excise duty, and consequently prevents any considerable
  stock from being manufactured until orders are actually received,
  and the varying fashions in printed callicoes, which render the
  expence of cutting the block by for the heaviest part of the
  disbursement for printing, are probably the chief reasons why
  manufacturers in this country have been less solicitous for the
  construction of machines calculated to afford profit only in the
  case of very numerous impressions. The physical difficulties
  of this art have likewise conspired, in no small degree, to
  prevent its having been applied in the large way to any but a
  few simple designs of the sort called running patterns in one
  colour.”--_Nicholson’s Journal_, vol. i. 1797.

The following is the statement respecting König’s machine, which was
the first that was made; it appeared in the Literary Gazette, with
an engraving; and as that Gazette was at the time printed by Mr.
Benjamin Bensley, at a machine, as well as from other circumstances,
I am led to believe that the information contained in it was supplied
by Mr. Bensley himself, and that, as far as it goes, it may be relied
upon.

  “The cylindrical mode of printing, which, in contradistinction to
  the old process by the press, is called _Machine Printing_, was
  invented by the late Mr. Nicholson, well known in the scientific
  and literary world, who took out a patent in the year 1790,
  though it does not appear that his plans and experiments ended
  in any actually practical result. Whether M. König, who at a
  later period more successfully attempted to print by machinery,
  was indebted to Mr. Nicholson for his elementary principles, or
  whether almost the same ideas spontaneously occurred to each
  individual, is a question that can only be satisfactorily solved
  by the former. Thus much is certain, that M. König’s labours
  were the first which produced any fruit:--and surely more is
  due to him who, after years of persevering toil, succeeds in
  the application of hitherto unapplied principles, than to one
  of whom we can only say that he was simply the first to suggest
  ideas--since no evidence is offered of their ever having been
  acted upon.

  “M. König, by birth a Saxon, and by occupation a printer, many
  years ago conceived it possible to print by Steam, though he
  then expected no more than to be able to give accelerated
  speed to the common press, to which end his first efforts were
  bent. As from the nature of such an undertaking, considering
  the state of scientific pursuits in his native land, he could
  calculate on little success unaided by others, and failing in his
  application for encouragement and support at the hands of the
  most eminent printers in several of the continental capitals,
  he turned his eyes towards England. Arriving in London about
  1804, he submitted his scheme to several printers of repute,
  who, not being disposed to incur the risk of property which a
  series of experiments was sure to entail, and perhaps placing
  little confidence in a successful issue, received his overtures
  very coolly: and it is probable his applications in this country
  would have shared the fate of similar attempts abroad, had he not
  finally been introduced to Mr. Bensley senior, who, attracted
  by M. K.’s plans, speedily entered into an arrangement with
  him. After a short course of experiments on the fabrication of
  a press which should have accelerated motion, and at the same
  time render the work of the man who _inks_ the type unnecessary,
  the above gentlemen were joined by Mr. G. Woodfall and Mr. R.
  Taylor, the former of whom however soon retired; the remaining
  three, in nowise discouraged by the tediousness and expense
  which all who are conversant with the progress of any invention
  in machinery well know to be unavoidable, persevered amidst
  unforeseen perplexities, which were doubtless not diminished by
  the parties’ deficiency in practical mechanical knowledge. It
  was at length discovered that the intended improvement of the
  common press could not be brought to bear--and that much labour
  and prodigious expence would be thrown away, unless more radical
  alterations were invented. Cylindrical printing was now thought
  of--and after some two or three years of renewed exertion, a
  small machine was brought forth, the characteristic of which was,
  that instead of the printing being produced by a flat impression
  (similar to the press) the sheet passed between a large roller
  and the types still flat; and in lieu of the old fashioned balls,
  used by hand to beat over the types and so to communicate the
  ink to their surface, skins were strained round smaller rollers,
  on which it was contrived to spread the ink, and under which the
  Form, _i. e._ the frame in which the types are fixed, passed in
  its way to the printing cylinder. Considerable promise of success
  attended this production; and after continued experiments, it was
  deemed practicable to extend the general principles to a more
  powerful machine. To print a newspaper was considered highly
  desirable--and on exhibiting to Mr. Walters, proprietor of the
  Times Newspaper, the Machine already erected, and shewing what
  further improvements were contemplated, an agreement was entered
  into with that gentleman for the erection of two large machines
  for printing his Journal. So secret had been the operations
  of the patentees, that the first public intimation of their
  invention was given to the reader of _The Times_ on Monday the
  28th of November, 1814, who was told that he then held in his
  hand one of many thousand impressions thrown off by steam. At
  this time but few persons knew of any attempt going on for the
  attainment of the above object; whilst among those connected with
  printing, it had often been talked of, but treated as chimerical.

  “The machines at the Times Office, cumbrous and complicated as
  subsequent improvements have made them appear, are yet in many
  respects admirably adapted to the purpose for which they were
  erected, and it is believed will outlast many contrivances for
  printing which have been since brought out.

  “The next advance in improvement was the manufacture of a machine
  for Messrs. Bensley, distinguished from those before mentioned
  by the mode of _perfecting_ (or printing on both sides)--so that
  the sheet of white paper is placed in the feeder, and delivered
  from the machine printed on both sides! In addition to the
  essential difference between this machine and those previously
  made, it came forth with many obvious improvements, though still
  unquestionably complex:--and for the first attempt at effecting
  register (causing the pages to fall precisely on the back of
  one another) a greater degree of success than might have been
  expected was attained, subsequent experience shewing the many
  difficulties to be surmounted in the accomplishment of this
  object. Deficiencies were now detected in the _inking_: the
  strained skins were found uneven in their surface; and attempts
  were made to clothe the rollers with an elastic preparation of
  glue, treacle, &c. which has at length attained perfection.

  “By this time the invention had attracted the attention of
  various individuals, who thought the manufacture of printing
  machines an easier task than they afterwards found it to be; and
  far the greater number of attempts, we believe, failed almost as
  soon as undertaken. A machine, however, similar in its capacities
  to that last mentioned, but much more simple in its construction,
  has been brought out--under the direction of some eminent
  engineers. It was not long before these gentlemen were requested
  to apply their _inking_ apparatus to Messrs. Bensley’s machine;
  and at one stroke, as it were, _forty wheels_ were removed--so
  great was the simplification: and at the same time the defects of
  the former system, of communicating the ink to the types, were
  most effectually remedied. Massive and complicated as it was,
  yet as an immense expense had been incurred in its erection,
  Messrs. Bensley went on using their machine until the destruction
  of their establishment by fire in 1819. And even after the
  rebuilding of the premises, the machinery, which had been only
  partially damaged, was reinstated, and worked for some time:--it
  has now, however, given place to two large and admirable machines
  built on the improved plan, which when inspected by a judicious
  eye can only create wonder at the heretofore circuitous manner
  adopted to attain ends so apparently within easy reach. The
  writer has no hesitation in stating that the original machine
  contained upwards of _one hundred_ wheels; whereas the new
  machine, with about _ten wheels_, accomplishes, in point of
  _quantity_, exactly the same object, and with a marked advantage
  in regard to the _quality_ of the printing. Another important
  point respecting the new machine is, that it occupies scarcely
  half the space of the original one.

  “The printing machine in its present state appears susceptible of
  little improvement. It produces excellent work, and its movements
  are attended with certainty and despatch--the double, or
  perfecting, machine throwing off 800 to 1000 sheets, printed _on
  both sides_, within the hour,--and the single machine delivering
  1500 or 1600 done _on one side_: which, in cases where one
  form of the types (as in newspapers) is ready to be worked off
  while the last side is preparing, is attended with the greatest
  advantage, since the rate of delivery thereby becomes doubled.
  The first is that by which our Gazette is printed, and the last
  described is that with which Mr. B. Bensley is now (and has
  for a considerable time been) printing the _Morning Chronicle_
  newspaper.

  “Other leading daily newspapers are also wrought off by steam;
  as well as several publications of extensive circulation.
  Like almost every ingenious invention, this has had no small
  portion of prejudice to encounter, and perhaps has been longer
  in forcing its way than many other schemes of real utility. The
  various advantages, however, which it holds forth have attracted
  the attention of several proprietors of the more extensive
  printing concerns, who have introduced it with benefit to the
  public--to whom, by means of this great reduction of labour, the
  productions of the press may be furnished at a reduced rate of
  charge.”--_Literary Gazette, October 26, 1822._

It may, perhaps, be allowable to make a few observations on this
statement, more particularly as Mr. Nicholson is seldom spoken of
in connexion with printing machines, and when he is, it is in such
a manner as to convey the impression that he was a visionary man,
who had some imaginary scheme in his head which he was incompetent
to carry into effect. To rebut this opinion I have given the
specification of his patent, with his own observations on his
invention, which certainly do not discover any symptoms of a weak or
a speculative man. I knew Mr. Nicholson personally, and I have no
doubt that, had he lived, he would have carried his invention into
effect; but he had a number of other pursuits which occupied his
time. He published a work on navigation, which I have seen quoted
as authority for its opinions; he was the author of a Dictionary of
Chemistry, in two quarto volumes; he edited and published monthly
Nicholson’s Journal of Science, &c. which was in high repute; he
wrote the Prospectus for the Royal Institution, on its establishment
in 1799; and he likewise kept a large school in Soho Square, the
leading feature of which was, a scientific education. I was, for
ten years, in the habit of hearing in an undisguised manner the
opinions of the most eminent scientific men in England,--as I held
the office of Assistant Secretary to the Board of Managers of the
Royal Institution, (the Secretary being an honorary officer,) also
that of Secretary to the Patrons of the Library, and Secretary to the
Committee of Chemistry, as well as Superintendant of their Printing
Office,--and in all that time I never heard his name mentioned but
with respect among these gentlemen, nor did I once hear him spoken
of as a visionary who would project schemes that he was unable to
execute. In addition to his multifarious pursuits, he was agent
to the late Lord Camelford, whose sudden death left Mr. Nicholson
involved in difficulties, from which he could never extricate himself.

Could this man, then, who planned the printing machine, and the
manner of printing calico, &c. in an improved and expeditious manner,
who moreover published the details of his process, with drawings of
the requisite machines, be deemed, with justice, nothing more than
“one of whom we can only say that he was simply the first to suggest
ideas,” this being all the merit that is allowed him by the Literary
Gazette? Now it appears to me that the term “suggesting ideas” refers
with rather more truth to Mr. König, who, coming to England with the
idea of applying steam as the moving power to presses, and being
supported by English capital, spent some years in unavailing efforts
to reduce his ideas to practice, and when he could not succeed, gave
up the attempt as one completely foiled, and turning round upon Mr.
Nicholson’s plan, produced a cylindrical printing machine.

Dr. Olinthus Gregory, in a lecture delivered by him before the
Mechanics Institution at Deptford, in 1826, among other topics
illustrative of the patronage afforded to the arts and sciences
by the intelligence and enterprise of this country, directed the
attention of his audience to “the case of Mr. König, a truly
ingenious foreigner, and his invention of an improved printing press,
in which, by duly blending the alternating and rotatory principles
of motion, the apparatus is capable of working off 1100 sheets an
hour, with the superintendance of two boys. Tracing the history of
his invention, of his difficulties, and of his want of encouragement,
through the greater part of the continent of Europe, Mr. König says,
‘I need hardly add, that scarcely ever was an invention brought to
maturity under such circumstances. The well known fact, that almost
every invention seeks, as it were, refuge in England, and is there
brought to perfection, seems to indicate that the Continent has yet
to learn from her the best manner of encouraging the mechanical arts.
I had my full share in the ordinary disappointments of continental
projectors; and, after having spent in Germany and Russia upwards of
two years in fruitless applications, I proceeded to England.’

“What could not be accomplished by the encouragement of princes on
the Continent,” proceeds Dr. Gregory, “was effected by the aid of
private individuals in London. A few enterprising printers,--and
their names cannot be mentioned but with honour on such an
occasion; Mr. Thomas Bensley, Mr. George Woodfall, and Mr. Richard
Taylor,--liberally assisted this ingenious foreigner in bringing his
invention to maturity. The machine was set to work in April 1811,
and 3000 copies of sheet H of the “New Annual Register for 1810,”
was printed by means of it. This was, doubtless, the first part of
a book ever printed solely by a machine. Messrs. Bacon and Donkin
were, it is true, simultaneously at work upon analogous contrivances,
and, since then, other ingenious artists, especially Applegath and
Cowper, have contributed greatly to the simplification of this class
of machinery.”

In 1818, Messrs. Donkin and Bacon obtained a patent for a most
ingenious but complex machine, which claims the merit of having been
the first to print with a circular movement of the types. It is said
that the invention of this machine was simultaneous with that of
König. A great point was gained in it, for the composition inking
rollers were first introduced in this machine, Mr. König’s having
rollers covered with leather, which were not found to answer the
purpose so well.

In this machine the patent specified the fastening of the pages of
type to the surface of a prismatic cylinder having any number of
planes from four to eight; to these types the ink was immediately
supplied by a large elastic roller placed over the type cylinder,
and made to rise and fall in accordance with the irregular motion of
the surfaces of the latter; two other and smaller rollers conveying
the ink from a receptacle to the larger roller. The sheet of paper
to be printed was applied to another revolving prism, composed of
segments of cylinders exactly adapted to meet the irregularities of
the type roller. To insure the niceties and regularities of motion
and of contact required in printing, toothed wheels, corresponding in
shape to the prisms, were placed upon the axis; and however strange,
at first sight, may appear to non-mechanical persons the working
together of metal wheels of such angular shapes, yet by providing for
a free vertical motion of the gudgeons of each roller, the operation
of the whole machine was steady and uniform. The annexed diagram,
representing a section of the principal parts, will enable the reader
to form a more correct idea of this curious machine.

The Norwich Mercury, a paper published by Mr. Bacon, contains a
prospectus of his newly invented machine, to which is added a notice
respecting its merit as compared with that of Mr. König, erected at
the Times printing office, from which statement the following is an
extract:--

“In Messrs. Bacon and Donkin’s machine, there is no reciprocating
motion. The types are placed on a prism of as many sides as the
nature of the form requires. This prism occupies the centre of an
upright frame, like the roller in a copperplate press; below this is
a kind of compound-faced roller, suited to the form of the prism;
through between these the sheets to be printed (attached to the face
of a piece of cloth) are passed in succession, and in the meantime
the revolution in the type prism brings its different portions in
succession under a system of inking rollers placed over it, by which
it receives successive charges of ink, to be delivered to the sheets
as they pass in succession between the lower rollers.”

Mr. Hansard, in his “Typographia,” says, that “one machine would not
answer for all kinds of work.” And “the only one of these machines
that was, I believe, ever made, rests in peace as not being found
useful.”

On the erection of the machines for printing the Times newspaper, Mr.
Bensley being apprehensive that there would be impediments thrown in
the way of their general introduction by the workmen, who had already
shown symptoms of opposition, was desirous that I should see them at
work, that he might have my opinion on the subject. I accordingly
went with Mr. Joseph Bensley, his eldest son, to look at them, and
view their manner of working, and on my return, Mr. Bensley was
anxious to see me, that he might have my report. I told him that
truly they surpassed any thing I had imagined, and did the work so
well, and so expeditiously, that I did not believe any opposition on
the part of the workmen could prevent their coming into use. This
opinion was gratifying to him: but I also told him that I foresaw
another thing that might probably take place, which would have an
equally injurious effect with respect to him. With considerable
anxiety he asked to what I alluded; I told him that I thought some
man of abilities would step in and simplify them, for they appeared
to me complex in their construction. He treated this suggestion with
indifference, as a thing that could never happen, and expressed
himself perfectly satisfied that no person would ever make the
attempt. My prognostication, however, was fulfilled; for immediately
after, Mr. Edward Cowper, of the firm of Applegath and Cowper,
printers, proved not only its possibility, but its practicability, by
sweeping away at once wheels, &c. which had cost, as I was credibly
informed at the time, at least 1500_l._ in the course of their
experiments; and thus made the machine more simple, and less liable
to be out of order, while he at the same time improved it greatly in
its facility of working, and in the quality of the work it produced.
Mr. Cowper took out a patent for his improvement; and, as I was
told, in consideration of the expense that Mr. Bensley had been at
in the pursuit, which amounted to at least 16,000_l._, offered him,
as an act of justice, a share of the patent, which was accepted. The
machine erected for “The Times” cost the proprietor of that newspaper
3,000_l._

Messrs. Applegath and Cowper then commenced manufacturing these
machines, which met with general approval; they also much improved
the inking apparatus. After the dissolution of their partnership,
Mr. Cowper established a manufactory for them at Manchester, in
conjunction with his brother, he himself continuing to reside in
London.

[Illustration: COWPER’S MACHINE FOR PRINTING BOOKS.]

In the year 1824 a new mode of machine printing was introduced, that
of printing with two colours simultaneously in the same impression.
This arose out of the Commission appointed by Government to inquire
into the best means of preventing the Forgery of Bank Notes. A
pamphlet was published by Sir William Congreve, describing the
process as inimitable, except by their machine, for which they had
a patent, so that no one else could possibly produce a facsimile. A
design was made, generally composed of a great number of lines in a
flourishing style, and, when engraved on two pieces of metal, these
lines were printed with two colours, one part sinking below the other
after each impression, and, there being two sets of inking rollers,
each part was inked at the same time, when the lower part rose again
to a level with the other, so that one part of these complicated
lines should be black, and the continuation of them should be blue or
red, or any other colour that might be thought proper, and any device
that might be included in the design should also be in two colours,
such, for instance, as the King’s arms, and the register should be
exact, so that each line should uniformly be perfectly continuous,
notwithstanding the change of colour. Government adopted the plan for
printing a new stamp on the backs of country bank notes, and also for
the Excise Stamps for paper. So far, however, from being inimitable,
I have no hesitation in saying, that there never was a plan suggested
that was more easy of imitation, even with the common press, and by
the customary workmen. The machines were made by Messrs. Donkin and
Co.

A single machine, that is, a machine which prints one side of the
paper only, may be estimated to produce upon the average one thousand
impressions in an hour; and were I to attempt to describe the one
by which the Times newspaper is now printed, I should state that
it is the mechanism of four single machines combined in one frame,
all being worked simultaneously by steam as the motive power: thus
there are four places at which to feed it with paper, four printing
cylinders, and four places at which the sheets are delivered when
printed, so that the actual speed of each part of the machine is
rather more than one thousand an hour. This ingenious and skilful
combination is the production of Mr. Augustus Applegath.

I have seen it stated by the proprietor of a machine, that it would
print at the rate of two thousand impressions in an hour: I have
known another assert that his perfecting machine would print one
thousand five hundred in the same time. This is a fallacy, which
produces disappointment and dissatisfaction. I have had occasion in
the course of business to satisfy myself as to their real capability,
by attending and carefully observing them at work, and have thus
ascertained that a single machine cannot be depended on for more than
one thousand in the hour, nor a perfecting machine for more than
seven hundred and fifty. I am well aware that both may be driven
with greater speed for a short time, but in the case of newspapers
and periodical publications, where punctuality is indispensably
requisite, I would never calculate upon greater expedition.

With respect to the comparative merits of the cylindrical method of
printing and those of the press, the manufacturers of machines as
well as most master printers, not content with the real superiority
of properties which the machine does certainly possess, attribute to
it properties which it does not possess, and which are incompatible
with it, namely, those of producing the finest work, and printing
the finest impressions from highly finished engravings on wood at
the rate of eight hundred or one thousand per hour; even an engraver
on wood has fallen into this error, and has produced a work with
numerous beautiful illustrations, in which the writer of the book has
boldly defended this erroneous opinion, but the engraver himself has
cautiously avoided the risk of, and shrunk from, the comparison,
and has had the book printed at the press. The Penny Magazine has
trumpeted the same fallacy; and yet the spirited Publisher has all
his splendid works, with their beautiful illustrations, printed also
at the press: thus tacitly acknowledging its superiority, and denying
the opinions which he is the means of publishing to the world.

In producing the finest workmanship in printing, it is essentially
requisite to use the best ink: this is ink made with strong varnish,
which binds the colouring matter, and, when dry, prevents its
smearing on being handled or setting-off in the process of binding;
the colouring matters are selected with care from among those of
the best quality; the whole is ground to a state of impalpability;
the strength of the varnish causes the ink to require a great deal
of distributing on the balls, which I prefer to rollers for the
best work,--_See_ BALLS,--in order to diffuse it equally on their
surface; the form should be well and carefully beat, so as to coat
the face of the types, &c. completely and uniformly with ink, without
any superfluity; the pressure should be slow and gradual, what is
termed a soaking pull, not quick and abrupt, and when the bar of the
press is brought home, the workman should rest there a short time,
in order to transfer the ink completely from the types, &c. to the
paper, and fix it firmly on its surface. These precautions and care
are necessary to produce the finest work in printing; and in every
instance, in whatever art or manufacture the article may be, good
workmanship and high finish will be found to require more time for
their production than in an inferior article.

From the rapidity with which impressions are produced by the
cylindrical method of printing, it must be apparent that it is not
capable of executing work of a superior kind, as the ink must be
weak to enable the light rollers to distribute it as expeditiously
as it is required; the ink too must be prepared with a soft varnish
to enable it to do so, which deprives it of the valuable property
of drying, as well as of binding the colouring matter so as not to
smear; this weak ink also incurs the risk of allowing the oil in the
varnish to separate from the colouring matter, and thus spread in the
paper and discolour it. Another imperfection is, that there is not
time to ink the face of the type, &c. properly, which is thus obliged
to be done in an imperfect manner with an inferior ink; and in
taking the impression, again for lack of time, there is not pressure
sufficient to fix the ink firmly to the paper.

As overlays cannot be used in cylindrical printing, the engravers on
wood, when producing a subject which is to be printed at a machine,
hollow out on the surface of the block the parts that are to appear
light, as well as round off the edges that are to be printed lightly,
and engrave on those lowered parts, so that the surface is not a
perfect plane; and this is to answer the purpose of overlays, thus
in practice allowing that of which they deny the necessity and which
they ridicule in theory--unequal pressure to produce the desired
effect; but the object is not gained by this method, for, to obtain
an impression from those lowered parts, thick woollen cloth, called
a blanket, is used, which, owing to its elasticity, is pressed into
the hollows as well as between the lines of the depths; so that an
impression is produced, in which the lights are composed of crude
lines, and the depths are muddy, and which show more than the
engraved line, and thus the wood-cut does not possess that delicacy
in the light parts, nor that firmness in the dark, which are produced
by good workmen at the press, and which give to the whole a brilliant
effect.

The hollowing of the block on its surface requires great care and
judgment, not only in ascertaining the precise situation and bounds,
but also the precise depth to which it ought to be lowered; for if a
thick blanket be used, the light parts will be produced stronger and
heavier than is required, and if a thin one be used, they will either
not appear, or, if they do, will be rotten, or else chalky; and
some small parts in the depths will always require to be of a full
firm colour, which a thick blanket and weak inferior ink will never
produce. _See_ ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD. FINE PRESSWORK.

The advantages that cylindrical printing possesses are of great
importance in the art, and not less so with respect to the public.
Its power of printing larger sheets of paper than was ever before
contemplated, has enabled the proprietors of newspapers to enlarge
them to a previously unparalleled extent. The rapidity with which
impressions are multiplied is also an advantage of great consequence,
as in the case of morning newspapers, instead of going to press on
the evening preceding the publication, they can now wait until five
o’clock in the morning, and even later, when if a despatch or an
express arrives with any important news, it is in the hands of the
public at the usual hour of publication; neither is this rapidity of
less advantage to periodical publications, more particularly to those
of which a large number is printed, for example, the Evangelical
Magazine, and the Methodists Magazine, of each of which there were
printed about 24,000 copies. When these were done at press, it
was necessary to put the last sheets to press ten days before the
publication, whereas now they can delay them till the third day, and
yet be punctual in publishing at the regular time. They thus avail
themselves of any later intelligence that may arrive, and give it
publicity a month earlier than before the invention of cylindrical
printing.

Another advantage in machine printing is, the regularity and
uniformity of colour through any number of impressions, as it can be
regulated with the greatest nicety to any shade; in this instance it
is superior to the press for the production of common work, in the
uniformity of colour, but only superior to common work in its rivalry
with the press.


MACULE.

If the joints of the tympan, or the head, or the nut of the spindle,
be loose, or any accident happen in pulling, so that the impression
be somewhat doubled, and not clear, it is said to be maculed. Cards
under the winter, to produce a spring, have often been the cause of
maculing: the sides of the tympan or the ear of the frisket touching
the cheeks will also produce the same effect. _See_ DOUBLE. SLURRING.


MAGAZINES. _See_ NEWSPAPER POSTAGE.


MAKE.

In casting off copy, they say it will _make_ so much; as, it will
make a sheet, two sheets, &c.


MAKE A MEASURE. _See_ JUSTIFY A STICK.


MAKING READY.

This term implies the process of laying the form on the press--fixing
it in its place--placing the tympan sheet on the tympan--placing
the points to make register, when both sides of the paper are to be
printed--making register--preparing the frisket--and producing an
equal impression from all the pages, and from every part of each page.

When an engraving on wood is printed, it also denotes the overlaying
it, so as to produce an impression, which shall possess all the
effect that the subject may require.

In common work, where despatch is required, thick blankets are used
in the tympans; and when the types are much worn they are also
necessary, to bring up the rounded face of the letter. It is too
common in good work to put an excess of blanket into the tympans,
to lessen the pull for the purpose of easing the pressmen’s arms,
and to enable them to be more expeditious: the consequence is, that
the impression will show more than the surface of the types or
engraving; and thus what is gained in ease and expedition, is more
than counterbalanced by the imperfect and rough impression that is
produced. _See_ FINE PRESSWORK, and ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD.

An old pressman, who was a good workman, gave me the following
directions for making ready a form:--

“In making ready, I will only speak of a form of fine work; if a
pressman can do that, he surely can make common work ready.

“Lay the form on the stone, centrically under the platen; quoin it
all round; fold the tympan sheet according to the form laid on the
press; lay it even on the form, and stretch it as much as it will
bear; pull it, for the purpose of attaching it to the tympan; paste
it all round to the tympan, at the same time keep stretching it;
screw on the points; make them fall in the channel of the short
cross; make good register with white paper, whether the form be whole
or half sheet work.

“This is one of the good old customs, and the best that I know
of; because the pressman is sure to have the points centrical; he
perceives whether all the furniture be put in right or wrong, even
to a single scale-board: in leaded matter, which should be line upon
line, he ascertains whether the form be locked up evenly or not,
and whether the leads be all put in right; also, whether the pages
that begin chapters, or other divisions of the work, have the proper
whites; he can likewise discover if any of the pages be made up too
long, or too short: any of these errors, that may have occurred,
must be amended in the white paper form, otherwise the reiteration
will have the same faults, in order to make register. On fine work, I
make ready the white paper form of a sheet in the same manner as I do
a half sheet, on purpose to discover those errors, by which process
I gain more time in making ready the reiteration than I lost in the
white paper form.

“For fine work, use the finest cloth that can be procured, and not
thick flannel blanket: if the form be light, one thin cloth blanket
will be sufficient; and if it be very light, that is to say open
leaded matter, sheets of paper are preferable to either flannel or
cloth in the tympans. Be sure to have one sheet of stout paper,
which will cover all the parchment, in the inside of the outer
tympan. Pull a dry even sheet of paper; look carefully on the back
of the impression; if it be not equally even, the light parts must
be overlaid with tissue paper, or India paper; if some parts be very
heavy, cut or tear out the heavy parts. The overlays should be pasted
only slightly on the impression sheet, in case any of them should
have to be taken off; paste the four corners of this sheet upon the
thick sheet; let the overlays be uppermost, that you may see them;
then pull another impression sheet, with the first in the tympans,
and if the impression still be not even, overlay the first impression
sheet again; and continue pulling impression sheets, and overlaying
the first impression sheet, until you have an even and regular
impression on all parts.

“As you go on with the form, if any of the overlays require to be
taken off, do so; if bits are required to be taken out, or rubbed
off, the tympan sheet, it must be done. In some works the outer
tympan cannot be too dry, but the pressman must be the judge of this,
according to the work he has to do.

“Having a good black ink well brayed on the surface of the ink
block, he takes a small quantity on the balls, and distributes it
well; he takes time to beat the form well and carefully, and then
pulls a sheet of the right paper, dwells on the pull, or keeps down
the bar a short time by means of a catch or hook, in order to make
the paper take the ink clean off the types, and look a clear black
upon the paper. The impression must not be too deep, as nothing must
appear but the shape of the face of good types. If the impression be
too deep, or too much ink on the form, more than the real shape will
appear, and the work will not be fine; but if the work be fine, he
goes on gently and regularly until the white paper be off. He then
lays on the reiteration form; and having the overlays ready that he
made before, he has very little trouble in making it ready: he makes
such good register, that line falls upon line. After the reiteration
is off, if he does not go on with the same work, or work of a similar
size and imposition, he carefully puts by the tympan blankets,
cloths, or tympan paper, and overlays, till they are again wanted
for the same work. All other works must have their own overlays made
purposely for them.

“After the first overlays are made for their respective works, there
is not so much trouble in making ready the future sheets of the same
work as they are put to press; indeed, if the pressman carefully
preserves his overlays, tympan paper, or cloths, he seldom has
occasion to do more than alter a few of the overlays, as the paper
sometimes varies in thickness, which may want a few overlays on the
tympan sheet. India paper is the best for this, as it is of a soft
and pliable nature, and as it lies on the tympan sheet the pressman
can easily perceive if one part of it has a deeper impression than
another.

“It is to be observed, that fine work cannot be made upon bad paper,
or with old worn types.

“Fine work must not be hurried, as some do when they are paid for
it as piecework, and spoil it, in order to make a large bill. How a
master stares at this, when the same men could not earn nearly so
much on scale work. These are the very men who have despised the
establishment, because they could earn more money by attending fewer
hours, but not on scale work. How miserable and discontented I have
seen them when on scale work, although at the same time they had
as much work as they could do. This has been the cause of masters
reducing the price of works not paid by the scale. A few shillings
per week additional ought to satisfy a man for his extra abilities on
fine work.”


MAKING REGISTER.

The act of making the pages and lines fall exactly on the back of
each other at press, when any work is perfected. _See_ REGISTER.


MAKE UP.

After a compositor has been setting at random, and commences
arranging his matter into pages, it is termed _making up_. In large
pages and letter, in a work where good register is required, I would
recommend the compositor to mark on a gauge accurately every line
of the page, so that he may regulate his whites in such a manner
that line may fall upon line without causing much trouble to the
pressman, or to himself; for if it be much out, and the pressmen are
on piecework, he will be called on to rectify the errors, and this is
better avoided in the making up, as it is attended with but little
trouble then, and his work will appear to more advantage in the first
instance.

_To give the making-up._ When a compositor in a companionship has
composed his copy to within the quantity of a page of the work, he
gives the overplus of the copy, after having completed his own last
page, to him who is composing the copy that follows his matter; and
he ought to mark on it with a pencil where he has himself concluded,
as well as the folio that should follow that of his own last page.
This is called _giving the making-up_.


MALABARIC. _See_ TAMOULIC.


MALAY.

The Malay is the principal vernacular tongue used by the people
who inhabit that vast region and chain of islands comprehended
between ninety-three and one hundred and thirty-five degrees of East
longitude, a space of about two thousand two hundred and twenty
miles; and extending from fourteen degrees North to eleven degrees of
South latitude, comprehending twenty-five degrees, about one thousand
seven hundred and forty miles. This vast extent of country over which
the language is spoken includes the peninsula of Malacca, the islands
of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Maccasser, Balee, Cumbava, Sallayer,
Bootoon, Booro, Ceram, Pulo Pinang, the Moluccas, and innumerable
others.

The Malays have not any proper national character, except that which
has been introduced by the Mohammedan priests, who have from time to
time settled in the peninsula of Malacca and the adjacent islands;
therefore it resembles the Arabic Nishki alphabet, excepting some
slight alteration to express a sound which the Arabians had no
character to delineate. In conformity then with the principal of the
Eastern nations, Arabians, Turks, Persians, &c. they read from the
right hand to the left.

The acute accent (´) is always used to mark a very long sound of the
vowel over which it is placed; but when inserted after a consonant,
it shows that the syllable ends with it.

In the above alphabetical arrangement, the second and fourth columns
from the right hand are used only when they are connected with a
preceding letter; as, _banyak_ بنيق‎, many. Every letter should be
connected with that which follows it, except these five: ا‎ aulif,
‎د‎ dal, ر‎ ré, ز‎ zé, and و‎ vau; neither of which can possibly
be joined to the following letter.


MALLET.

A wooden hammer, with which to drive the quoins in locking up and
unlocking forms, to plane down forms, and for other similar purposes.
The general size of the head is 5 inches by 4¼, and 3 inches thick:
the hole in the head for the reception of the handle should be
bevelled each way from the centre on two sides, so that the handle
fitting into the lower part, and being tightly wedged at the upper
end, the head can neither fly off, nor can the handle be driven up,
when a quoin is struck down with it, or when the planer is struck
with the end of it, both which ways of using the mallet are frequent.
It is commonly made of beech; but mallets are more durable when the
head is made of a piece of tough ash. The head was formerly made
round.


MARGIN.

Making margin is the apportioning of the proper distances between the
pages of a sheet or form.

This is a most material object in book work; for, if it be not
properly done, the appearance of the book, when bound, will be
injured; as the binder will be obliged either to reduce the size of
the book, in order to make the edges smooth, or else he will have to
leave many raw edges of paper.

The spaces between the pages should be such, that, when the book is
bound and cut, the page of printing should be very nearly in the
middle of the page of paper.

Convenience and custom have familiarised us to the printed page being
a little higher than the middle of the leaf, and to its having a
little more margin at the fore edge than in the back.

The first of these circumstances may be accounted for, by the head,
in all sizes except folio, being at the fold of the paper, which
admits of the bookbinder cutting it smooth by taking off a very
narrow shaving, so as to reduce the size but a mere trifle; while
the bottom of the page lying towards the raw edge of the paper,
which is irregular, and which often varies considerably from being
cater-cornered--machine-made paper also varies greatly in the
size of the sheets, being cut up irregularly; and paper made at
different times, and by different makers, which is often used in
the same volume, and which likewise varies in size--all combined,
render it necessary to allow a little more margin at the foot of
the page and at the fore edge than at the head and in the back; for
these variations in the paper equally affect the fore edge and the
foot: but the head, the back, and the gutter, being folded, remain
uniformly the same, however much the paper may vary.

It is always presumed that the backing of the book in binding, takes
up as much of the margin as is cut off the fore edge, so as to make
them both equal.

Having premised these explanatory observations, I shall proceed
to describe, in as clear and distinct a manner as I am able, the
manner of ascertaining the proper spaces between the pages, for the
different sizes of books, in the simplest way that is known, and as
it is now generally practised; for the division of the margin by
compasses is obsolete.

To facilitate the operation, it will be necessary to keep in mind the
observation I made in the article IMPOSING, that, “when we arrive at
a great number of pages in a sheet, they resolve themselves into the
same order as quartos, octavos, and duodecimos,” as a recollection of
this will tend to simplify the process, and, if the person who has to
perform it be not well experienced, it may prevent him from getting
confused, by keeping him to a small part of the form, instead of
leaving him to attempt doing all at once.

After the pages have been laid upon the imposing stone, and the
chases put over them, the first thing to be done is to get a sheet
of the proper paper of the work, wet, and to fold it as exactly as
possible to the size in which the work is intended to be printed.

If the paper for the work has not been sent in, then a sheet of the
same size may be taken from the paper of some other work that is in
progress, which will be found to be sufficiently near, inasmuch as a
scaleboard or two in the backs and heads, more or less, will make it
right; or the first sheet may be imposed temporarily with furniture
out of the drawer.

I must here caution the compositor, or the person who has this
business to perform, never to cut his furniture till he is certain of
the proper distance required between the pages.

To ascertain this distance, take short pieces of furniture out of the
drawer, or quotations, or both, and quadrats or reglets to fill up
the interspace, between two pages; then push the pages close up to
them, and when you have got the right distance between the pages, you
can ascertain what furniture will be of the exact width, by trying
the ends of different pieces, always measuring from the edges of the
types themselves, and not within the page cords.

We will now proceed with making margin, commencing with folio, and
proceeding through the various sizes, at least through so many as may
be necessary to elucidate the subject.


FOLIO.--Having folded a sheet of the intended paper exactly in the
middle, place the edge of the paper even upon the outer edge of the
first page, and move the adjoining page to it till the fold in the
paper will lie about half an inch upon it, when the folded sheet is
laid upon the face of the first page; the space between the pages
on either side of the cross is then to be filled up with furniture,
using one piece only on each side where it is practicable, and where
there is no reason to the contrary, in order to prevent mistakes in
re-imposing. This space, with the addition of one or two scaleboards
on each side of the cross, which are to assist in making register at
press, will be sufficiently near for a demy folio, where the page
is of a fair dimension; but if the page be very large, or if it be
a smaller sized paper than demy, I would not allow the back fold of
the paper to lie quite so much over the adjoining page, but would
lessen it in proportion to the size of the page or paper; if it be
very large paper and a corresponding margin, I would allow a little
more proportionably; for it is to be observed, that the more the fold
of the paper lies over the edge of the adjoining page, the more fore
edge is given at the margin than in the back.

The margin for the head of a folio is arranged at press.

After the scaleboards have been put in, the page cords taken off, and
the pages pushed up close to the furniture, you should try it again,
to see that it is correct. It is a good plan to take a slip of paper,
and cut it to a length equal to the width of the back, then to fold
it even in the middle so as to make a distinct crease, to open it
again and lay it in the back, so that the crease shall be exactly in
the middle of the back; then to open out the sheet of paper, and lay
it upon the form, with the crease in its middle upon the crease in
the slip of paper; the margin in the back may then be compared with
the margin in the fore edge as well as if the sheet were printed, and
it may be altered if thought necessary by a scaleboard more or less.

If two jobs, that are to be cut up, are worked together, it is usual
to impose them so that the margin shall be equal on both sides; to
effect this, fold the paper exactly in the middle, and laying it
folded upon the left hand page with the edge of the paper even with
the edge of the page of types, bring the other page to it till the
left hand side fairly touches the fold of the paper; this is termed
being out and out; and when the paper is cut evenly in two, after
having been printed, the side margins will be found to be equal.


QUARTO.--Fold a sheet of paper exactly into quarto; then lay it,
thus folded, upon the first page, the fore edge of the paper being
even with the left hand edge of the types; bring the adjoining page
towards the first page till the fold in the paper lies upon the left
hand side of it about as much as a Double Pica body; this will make
the back about right: then place the lower edge of the paper even
with the foot of the page, and bring the heads of the pages which
adjoin at that part towards each other till the fold in the paper
covers the head line, and barely the first line of matter; this will
make the head right. Then fit the furniture into the spaces; add a
scaleboard or two, as the case will admit; and, after cutting and
folding slips of paper and laying them in the back and head, open out
the sheet of paper, laying the folds in the paper exactly over the
folds in the slips, and it will be perceived how the margin is to be
for all the pages.

Before I proceed to octavo, it will be necessary to observe, that
in all sizes except folio and quarto, if there be not enough in the
backs, the raw edge of the paper in the front margin will project
beyond the folded margin, and this in proportion to the deficiency in
the back; the same will take place in the length in duodecimo, and in
smaller sizes where there are offcuts, if there be not enough at the
foot of the pages whence the offcut is taken: the effect produced by
these deficiencies is, that the binder is obliged to reduce the size
of the book both in length and width, when cutting, in order to make
the edges smooth.

The French allow the raw edge of the paper in the front to extend
considerably beyond the folded edge; and also at the foot in
duodecimos: in England we endeavour to give the book the fullest size
that the paper will permit, and suffer the raw edge of the front
margin to project but a very little beyond the folded edge, to allow
for any discrepancy in the size or shape of the paper.


OCTAVO.--Fold a sheet of paper into octavo, and lay it, thus folded,
upon the first page, the fore edge of the paper even with the outer
edge of the types: then bring the adjoining page towards it till the
other side of the octavo paper lies over the left hand side of this
page about a Pica; this will give the width of the gutter: then open
the paper out a fold, into quarto, and laying it upon the two pages,
bring the third page on the right hand sufficiently near for the
right hand side of the paper to lie upon the left hand side of the
page about a Long Primer body; this will give the width of the back:
then fold the paper up again, and laying it upon the first page, with
the foot of the paper even with the direction line, bring the head
of the page above it so near that the top of the octavo paper will
cover the head line and barely also the first line of matter; this
will give the space at the head: then put into all the spaces on one
side of the long cross, and into the head, small pieces of furniture
from the drawer, or quotations, which are generally used where they
will fit, or quadrats, making both the gutters alike, and push the
pages up close; cut the slips of paper as before, and fold them; lay
them in the gutters, head and back, and open the sheet of paper to
its full size; lay it with the crease of the middle fold exactly upon
the crease of the slip of paper in the back, and if the margin be
right the creases between the other pages will fall exactly upon the
creases in the slips of paper laid in the gutters; if they do not,
the space in the back must be increased or diminished till they do,
when the margin will be right; the furniture may then be cut, and a
scaleboard inserted next the crosses at the backs and heads in all
the quarters.


DUODECIMO.--After folding a sheet of paper exactly into 12mo.,
proceed as in octavo for the gutter, but let the fold lie rather less
over the edge of the adjoining page than a Pica; proceed in the same
manner for the back, but that the paper lie on the third page barely
a Long Primer body will be sufficient; the fold in the head will just
cover the top line of matter in the adjoining page above it, as in
octavo, but the pieces of furniture put in there are called bolts.
The offcut is now to be considered--this is always imposed on the
outside of the short cross, and the back and gutters are the same as
those in the other part of the sheet; for the head of the offcut, the
space between the running title, or, where there is no running title,
the headline, and the middle of the groove in the short cross, must
be exactly half the width of the bolts; for as register is made at
this part, and the points fall into the groove and there make point
holes, the binder folds to these holes, and takes off the offcut
in accordance: thus when the sheet is folded, the offcut inserted,
and knocked-up, the head lines of the offcut ought to range with the
head lines of the other pages, and this should always be kept in view
by the printer; the space between the bottom of the other pages and
the middle of the groove in the short cross, should be within a Pica
of the outer margin at the feet of the pages, which will allow for
any little variation in the size of the paper, and not affect the
size of the book in cutting the edges: when these distances are thus
arranged, put short bits of furniture, quotations, &c., as before
directed, between the pages, in the gutters and back in one row,
and in the head and both sides of the short cross in another row
lengthways, and push the pages of both these rows close up: cut the
slips of paper and fold them for the gutters and the back, as also
for the bolts: then open out the sheet of paper, and lay the middle
crease in it exactly upon the crease in the slip of paper laid in the
back; and if the side margin is right, the creases in the sheet of
paper between the other pages will fall upon the creases in the slips
of paper laid in the gutters; if they do not, the space in the back
must be altered till they do: then try it the other way, by laying
the crease in the sheet of paper upon the crease in the slip laid in
the bolt, and if the crease of the offcut falls exactly in the middle
of the groove in the short cross, it is right; if it does not, the
space at the feet of the pages next the cross must be altered till
it does: it being presumed that the gutters and bolts are right, the
only places at which to alter are the back, and the space at the feet
of the pages adjoining the offcut; a scaleboard or two, as may be
required, must be put into all the quarters next the crosses.

In _Duodecimo Music way_, the pages are reversed in shape, being so
wide as for two of them to occupy the width of the sheet, and so
short as to have six in the depth; in this case there are no backs,
technically so called, but only gutters; but as the long cross
comes between the pages, they must be treated as backs, in the same
manner as in folio, and the fold of the paper must be allowed to lie
more over the side of the adjoining page, as was described in making
margin for folio; if the page be very wide, less than half an inch;
if it be narrow, and a large margin, it may be a little more; the
head margins or bolts are three in depth, and may be ascertained in
the same manner precisely as for octavos or common twelves, which,
being done, the foot margins must be ascertained; these, being two,
may have a Pica body each less than the outer foot margins, to allow
for any inequality in the size of the paper, or in laying on the
white paper at press; this will be done by folding the sheet of paper
exactly in three portions across it, and extending the pages till one
of these portions covers the two outer pages with the gutter, and
lies over the third about a Pica body; when this has been performed
at one end, repeat the same process at the other end of the form.
The margin may then be tried in the manner before described, and any
necessary alteration must be made in the space at the feet of the
pages, care being taken that both spaces are equal.

In _Long Duodecimo_, the pages are the same in size as in the
preceding, only that they exchange the length for width, and the
width for length; the manner of making margin is the same for this
size as for the last; the only difference between them being one of
words--that which was the gutter in the other being the head in this;
and what was the head or bolt, and the foot margin, now becoming
the gutter and the back; the spaces between the pages, for heads,
for gutters, and for backs, are ascertained in the manner before
described.

As the number of pages multiply in a sheet, so the utility of placing
slips of paper, folded in the middle, in the gutters, backs, &c.,
becomes greater, by enabling the person, whose office it is, to know
readily the middle of each space when he tries the whole margin with
the sheet opened out; to some this may appear unnecessarily minute,
but I hold that whatever method tends to facilitate an operation, and
enables a person to perform it more correctly, is useful.


SIXTEENS.--After having described so fully the manner of folding the
paper, and ascertaining the spaces between the pages for the gutters,
the heads, and the backs, which are required for quartos, octavos,
and duodecimos, it appears unnecessary to extend this article by
repeating the same thing in every size. For sixteens, fold a quarter
of a sheet of paper exactly in four; pursue the foregoing direction
for ascertaining the width of the gutter, the back, and the head, in
one quarter of the form, and having made these right, arrange the
remainder of the form in the same manner, always trying all the pages
by the whole sheet opened out, and rectifying any thing wrong by
adding or diminishing in the backs, and similarly at the feet of the
pages next the short cross.

The greater the number of pages in a sheet, the smaller in proportion
does the margin become: it must therefore be evident, that the folded
paper should lie proportionably less over the edge of the adjoining
page, both for gutter and for back, as the number of pages increases;
for as a folio may require the page to be half an inch nearer the
back than the fore edge, an eighteens may not require it to be more
than a Long Primer; and so in proportion with respect to the size of
the page and of the margin.


EIGHTEENS.--A sheet of eighteens is the same as three half sheets of
twelves imposed together: there are two backs and three gutters in
each form: the other way of the chase it is three pages in depth,
having bolts and an offcut the same as twelves; and the process is
the same as when making margin for twelves, only ascertaining the
first gutter and back by one third of the sheet of paper the long
way, instead of one half of it the narrow way: having made the six
pages on the left hand of the form right, make the remaining twelve
pages like them, and then try the whole with the sheet of paper
opened out; the creases in the folds should fall exactly in the
middle of the gutters and backs; but as the offcut is not imposed on
the side of the short cross with the groove in it, the crease for the
offcut should be exactly half the width of the bolt from the running
title or headline, or it should fall in the middle of the long cross.

I wish here to impress upon the mind of the person who is making
margin, never to attempt doing so with the whole form at once; for
if he does, it is more than probable that he will get wrong, cause
himself additional trouble, and frequently waste furniture; but
let him get one portion right, then make a range of pages through
the form one way the same, and then another the contrary way, and
afterwards try them with the sheet of paper opened out, when any
little variation that may occur will be easily remedied before he
cuts the furniture.


TWENTIES.--A form of this size has four pages in width, and five in
length; in width the margin will be made in the same manner as for
twelves; in the length there are two heads or bolts, which will be
also ascertained as for twelves; the space between the feet of the
pages must be out and out, except about a Pica body; and the offcut
must be treated the same as for a form of twelves or eighteens.


TWENTY-FOURS.--The side margin will be ascertained just as for
eighteens, there being the same number of pages in width; and the
head and foot margin as for sixteens; the difference in the size of
the pages not affecting the principle of making margin.

_Long Twenty-fours._--A form of this size is similar to a sheet
of twelves imposed in one chase, the width of the pages being the
longest way of the paper: the method of making margin for it will be
similar to that for twelves or eighteens.

_Square Twenty-fours._--The difference between this size and
twenty-fours is, that the width of the pages occupy the sheet the
longest way; the margin will be made in the same manner.


THIRTY-TWOS.--One quarter of a form of thirty-twos is similar to a
form of octavo; and the margin may be made by folding a quarter of a
sheet of paper, and arranging the pages of a quarter of the form only
in the first instance: then place the others at the same relative
distances, and try the whole with the sheet of paper opened out,
before cutting the furniture.

There is no variation in any principle of making margin as to the
remaining sizes; and if I were to go into detail for each, it would
be but a repetition of the method of ascertaining the width of the
gutters, backs, heads or bolts, and of the spaces at the feet of
the pages where they either cut up, or fold, at that part, which I
think unnecessary; for when a person is competent to make margin
correctly for an octavo, a twelves, and an eighteens, he will find no
difficulty with respect to the other sizes.

Wherever a half sheet is imposed, or two half sheets to work
together, the middle margin, where the sheet is cut in two, should
always be made out and out, that both the fore edges may be equal.

When the margin to the first sheet of a work has been made, and
the quoins tightened with the fingers, a gauge should be cut for
the back and head, for the succeeding sheets. _See_ ALTERATION OF
MARGIN.--GAUGE.--IMPOSING.


MARGINAL NOTES,

generally called side notes by printers, are notes at the fore edge
of the page, running from top to bottom, or placed opposite the
matter to which they refer, when they are short. They are generally
of the width of a broad quotation; in historical works, where there
is only a date at the top of each page, a narrow quotation is run
down the side. They are always used in acts of parliament, and in law
books, and contain a short abstract of the clause to which they are
affixed, and should be justified to range with the line to which they
refer.

It is usual, where marginal notes are not heavy, to economise the
metal quotations by using furniture; in this case I would advise
the compositor to select pieces of precisely the same width, but of
different short lengths, and to cut their ends square; some should
extend the length of the page; and when he uses short pieces, that he
always put a metal quotation or a justifier next to the note, which
will cause the lines to stand more even; he will then not lose so
much time in seeking quotations and justifiers, nor will he be blamed
for monopolising them, as they are seldom so plentiful in an office
as to allow of being lavishly used.

MATHEMATICAL COMBINATIONS.

This is the name given by Messrs. Thorowgood and Besley to a number
of ornamental designs for letter-press printing, which they were,
in the first instance, the means of introducing into England from
Paris, these being the invention and execution of Mons. Derriey, a
French artist. In England, they come under the denomination of what
are called Flowers; but Messrs. V. & J. Figgins style them Changeable
Borders.

The flowers in the English founderies have received little
improvement or addition during the last hundred years, and are not
remarkable either for their beauty or taste: the consequence is,
that they are seldom used, hardly ever indeed in fine works. It is
difficult to account for this apathy of our letter founders and
artists, for the few improvements that have been introduced, have
generally been copied from French patterns.

The borders in question are a great improvement, and will, by
exciting emulation, most probably lead to others still greater. They
are of various patterns, formed of straight lines, as well as of
diversified curves; the corners are also formed of angles and curves,
so that they may be combined into an almost innumerable variety of
forms; in addition, there are many detached tasteful pieces, which,
when judiciously used, will add greatly to the effect; but unless the
workman possess judgment with some taste, it is doubtful whether he
will be able to produce a border, or any other subject, that will be
gratifying to the eye.

That the reader may himself form an opinion of these borders, I have
given two pages in which several of these pieces are arranged so
as to show their effect. Those who are desirous of seeing all the
varieties, may find them in the type founders specimen books, where
there are a number of borders of different forms and patterns, which
are combined in such a manner as to convince the beholder of the
superiority of these ornaments over our old class of flowers.

As the French and German type founders, when they produce any new
devices, sell matrices of them as articles of trade, the ornaments
that are now introduced into England, have consequently all been
manufactured from the same punches.

MEDHURST’S PRESS.

A few years ago, a new press was constructed by Mr. Medhurst, of
London, the great recommendation of which was its simplicity, and
consequent cheapness. In its general form it much resembled the iron
presses in common use, the principal difference being in the manner
in which the pressure was produced. This was accomplished by means
of an ingenious arrangement of levers, differing so much from every
thing previously employed in machinery, that the inventor described
his contrivance as one which exhibited a new power in mechanics.

[Illustration: Medhurst’s press]

The principle upon which this press acts will be understood from
the annexed sketch of the parts by means of which the impression
is given. Instead of a screw, a plain spindle is employed: on the
lower part of this spindle there is a swell or collar, A, into which
the handle, or working bar of the press, B, is fastened. The upper
part of this collar has cups or steps for the reception of two short
iron props or pins, C, D, which extend up to the head of the press,
and are there supported by the points of two screws, E, F, entering
sockets cut out in the heads of the pins, which are made of steel.
When the platen is up, these pins stand in an inclined position,
as represented in the annexed figure: but when the lever handle
is pulled towards the spectator, so as to turn the spindle, the
two screws remain stationary, while the props come into a vertical
position, thus forcing the spindle and attached platen to descend, as
if a screw were employed. It may be observed that, in the figure, G
is merely a section of the head of the press, which is supposed to be
looked at sidewise, to present the back and front projections, H, I,
through which the screws pass.--_Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopædia_, 1833.

METAL.

The technical name of a mixture of metals properly so called, with
which types and stereotype plates are cast.

In speaking of type metal, I shall first give Moxon’s description of
making it, which is curious; and then some interesting observations
on the same subject by M. Sage, from the Journal de Physique.

  Moxon says--“What the metal founders make printing letters of,
  is lead hardened with iron: thus, they choose stub nails for the
  best iron to melt, as well because they are assured stub nails
  are made of good, soft, and tough iron, as because they (being in
  small pieces of iron) will melt the sooner.

  “To make the iron run, they mingle an equal weight of antimony
  (beaten in an iron mortar into small pieces) and stub nails
  together. And preparing so many earthen forty or fifty pounds
  melting pots (made for that purpose to endure the fire) as they
  intend to use: they charge these pots with the mingled iron and
  antimony as full as they will hold.

  “Every time they melt metal, they build a new furnace to melt
  it in: this furnace is called an open furnace; because the air
  blows in through all its sides to fan the fire: they make it of
  bricks in a broad open place, as well because the air may have
  free access to all its sides, as that the vapours of the antimony
  (which are obnoxious) may the less offend those that officiate at
  the making of the metal: and also because the violent fire made
  in the furnace should not endanger the firing any adjacent houses.

  “They consider, before they make the furnace, how many pots of
  metal they intend to melt, and make the furnace sizeable to that
  number: we will suppose five pots. Therefore they first make a
  circle on the ground capable to hold these five pots, and wider
  yet by three or four inches round about: then within this circle
  they lay a course of bricks close to one another to fill the
  plain of that platform, with their broad or flat sides downwards,
  and their ends all one way, and on this course of bricks they
  lay another course of bricks as before, only the lengths of this
  course of bricks lies athwart the breadths of the other course of
  bricks; then they lay a third course of bricks with their lengths
  cross the breadth of the second course of bricks.

  “Having thus raised a platform, they place these five pots in the
  middle of it close to one another, and then on the foundation or
  platform raise the furnace round about by laying the bricks of
  the first lay end to end and flat, close to one another: on the
  second lay, they place the middle of a brick over a joint (as
  the bricklayers call it) that is, where the ends of two bricks
  join together, and so again lay bricks end to end till they trim
  round the platform. Then they lay a third lay of bricks, covering
  the joints of the second lay of bricks as before: so is the
  foundation finished.

  “Then they raise the walls to the furnace on this foundation; but
  do not lay the ends of their bricks close together, but lay the
  ends of each brick about three inches off each other, to serve
  for wind holes till they trim round about: then they lay another
  lay of bricks, leaving other such wind holes over the middle of
  the last lay of bricks, and so trim as they work round, either
  with half bricks or bats, that the wind holes of the last lay may
  be covered: and in this manner and order they lay so many lays,
  till the walls of the furnace be raised about three bricks higher
  than the mouths of the melting pots, still observing to leave
  such wind holes over the middle of every brick that lies under
  each lay.

  “Then they fill the sides of the furnace round about the melting
  pots, and over them, with charcoal, and fire it at several wind
  holes in the bottom, till it burn up and all over the furnace,
  which a moderate wind in about an hour’s time will do: and about
  half an hour’s time after, they lay their ears near the ground
  and listen to hear a bubbling in the pots; and this they do so
  often till they do hear it. When they hear this bubbling, they
  conclude the iron is melted: but yet they will let it stand,
  perhaps half an hour longer or more, according as they guess the
  fire to be hotter or cooler, that they may be the more assured it
  is all thoroughly melted. And when it is melted, the melting pot
  will not be a quarter full.

  “And in or against that time, they make another small furnace
  close to the first, (to set an iron pot in, in which they melt
  lead,) on that side from whence the wind blows; because the
  person that lades the lead out of the iron pot (as shall be
  shewed by and by) may be the less annoyed with the fumes of
  the metal, in both furnaces. This furnace is made of three or
  four course of bricks open to the windward, and wide enough to
  contain the designed iron pot, with room between it and the sides
  to hold a convenient quantity of charcoal under it, and about it.

  “Into this iron pot they put for every three pound of iron, about
  five and twenty pounds of lead. And, setting fire to the coals in
  this little furnace, they melt and heat this lead red hot.

  “Hitherto a man (nay, a boy) might officiate at all this work;
  but now comes labour would make Hercules sweat. Now they fall to
  pulling down so much of the side of the open furnace as stands
  above the mouth of that melting pot next the iron pot, and having
  a thick strong iron ladle, whose handle is about two yards long,
  and the ladle big enough to hold about ten pounds of lead, and
  this ladle red hot that it chill not the metal; they now, I say,
  with this ladle, fall to clearing this first melting pot of all
  the coals or filth that lie on the top of the melted metal; while
  another man at the same time stands provided with a long, strong,
  round iron stirring poot, the handle of which stirring poot is
  also about two yards long or more, and the poot itself almost
  twice the length of the depth of the melting pot: this poot is
  nothing but a piece of the same iron turned to a square with the
  handle: and this poot is also in a readiness heated red hot.

  “Now one man with the ladle lades the lead out of the iron pot
  into the melting pot, while the other man with the poot stirs and
  labours the lead and metal in the melting pot together, till they
  think the lead and metal in the melting pot be well incorporated:
  and thus they continue lading and stirring till they have near
  filled the melting pot.

  “Then they go to another next melting pot, and successively to
  all, and lade and stir lead into them as they did into the first.
  Which done, the metal is made: and they pull down the walls of
  the open furnace, and take away the fire that the metal may cool
  in the pots.

  “Now (according to custom) is half a pint of sack mingled with
  sallad oil, provided for each workman to drink; intended for an
  antidote against the poisonous fumes of the antimony, and to
  restore the spirits that so violent a fire and hard labour may
  have exhausted.”--_Moxon._

Smith, who published his Printer’s Grammar about seventy years after
the appearance of Moxon’s work, says, “In Germany they use more than
three ingredients to their metal, which is there made of steel,
iron, copper, brass, tin, and lead; all which they incorporate with
each other by means of antimony. This metal, if duly prepared, does
not bend, but breaks like glass; it is harder than tin and lead,
something softer than copper, and melts sooner than lead. This
account I have of Mr. Struke, a printer at Lubec.”


  “_Observations on the Metallic Mixture made use of for casting
  Letters, or Characters, for Printing. By M. Sage. From the
  Journal de Physique._

  “Lead and regulus of antimony, melted together in various
  proportions, form the metal used by letter founders, for casting
  their different types or characters. When I say that these metals
  are used in various proportions, I mean, that more or less of
  the regulus of antimony is mixed with the lead, according to the
  degree of hardness the types are required to possess. In general,
  eighty pounds of lead are added to twenty pounds of regulus of
  antimony, already melted: but, for the small characters, in which
  a greater degree of hardness is required, seventy-five pounds of
  lead are used to twenty-five pounds of regulus of antimony; and,
  for large ones, eighty-five pounds of lead, and fifteen pounds of
  regulus of antimony.

  “These two substances, though of very different specific
  gravities [Lead, 11·35--Antimony 6·70.--_W. S._], remain
  perfectly combined, and do not separate from each other by
  fusion, unless the fire made use of is so strong as to burn and
  volatilize them; in that case, the antimony begins to exhale.

  “Letter founders should take care to employ only the purest
  regulus of antimony, or that which is the most free from sulphur;
  for, when it contains any of that substance, it acts upon the
  lead, in the course of time, and forms with it a kind of galena,
  which acquires a black colour. The letters cast with a mixed
  metal of that kind, instead of preserving their shining and
  polished appearance, become dull, and as it were cracked, forming
  also a sort of efflorescence. When this spontaneous decomposition
  takes place, the letters become brittle, and lose their form. Of
  this I have been convinced, by having analysed a mixture of this
  kind, with which M. Anisson had cast some Arabic characters.

  “Having exposed some of the letters, made with this bad metal,
  to a violent fire, the sulphur it contained burnt, and exhaled,
  in the form of vitriolic acid. Having then poured the metal
  remaining in the crucible into an ingot, it acquired a white
  brilliant colour like silver; which colour did not become
  sensibly changed, by being left, for the space of six months, in
  a damp place.

  “Regulus of antimony is prepared, in the large way, by melting
  calcined antimony, in a reverberatory furnace, with dried wine
  lees; from this is obtained the regulus, which is sold in the
  form of round cakes, on the surface of which are seen figures
  like the leaves of fern, &c. which figures are produced from the
  elements of octoëdral crystals. If the regulus, thus prepared,
  appears more grey in colour than when it is prepared according
  to Stahl’s process, it is because it still retains a portion of
  sulphur.

  “At present, there is not found a sufficient quantity of regulus
  of antimony in commerce to supply the letter founders. It appears
  to me that, in the place of regulus of antimony prepared as
  above, we might substitute that which may be prepared with iron.
  One-fifth part of iron is sufficient to absorb all the sulphur
  with which antimony is mineralized. When this mixture is melted,
  it must be poured into a cone: the sulphuretted iron remains upon
  the surface of the regulus, and is very easily separated from it.

  “This process is less expensive, and produces more regulus, than
  the process made use of by those who work the mines of antimony.

  “Regulus of antimony, as we have seen, gives hardness to lead;
  but a much greater degree of hardness is produced by adding tin
  to the mixture. I have analysed some nails which were proposed to
  be used in shipbuilding, and found them to contain three parts
  of tin, two parts of lead, and one part of regulus of antimony.
  These nails were sufficiently hard to penetrate oak wood, without
  being blunted; and this metallic mixture is not acted upon by sea
  water, which very quickly decomposes iron.”

These observations of M. Sage show the utility of iron in the making
of type metal by our predecessors, from its combining with the
sulphur contained in the antimony.

Stereotype founders vary considerably the proportions of lead and
regulus of antimony in making their metal. The hardest metal made,
is in the proportion of ten pounds of regulus of antimony to forty
pounds of tea lead; but the general proportions are ten pounds of
regulus of antimony to sixty pounds of lead, which are said to make a
mixture of a good quality.


METAL RULES.

Straight lines cast on pieces of metal similar to quadrats, but
higher; they are rarely cast to founts larger than English. They
are used as leaders; to cut off sums of money from the line which
contains the sum total; for transverse lines in columns; sometimes
for column rules, but very seldom; and for blanks, where the names
of persons, &c., are omitted; em metal rules are sometimes used for
divisions in a paragraph instead of a point. They are generally of
one em, two ems, three ems, and four ems, but in English founts
their size does not exceed three ems; sometimes there are en metal
rules cast. Metal rules ought to be cast exactly on the middle of
the body, and be continued precisely to the sides, so as to join
each other at the ends, even if they are placed alternately with the
sides reversed; should this not be the case, the continuity of the
line must be broken, and it will necessarily have a disagreeable
appearance.

MONK.

When the pressman has not distributed his balls, some splotches of
ink may lie on one or both of them, which in beating he delivers upon
the form, so that the sheet printed on has a black blotch on it,
which blotch is called a _Monk_--_M._ The same effect will take place
also with rollers, if care be not taken to roll them backwards and
forwards, as well as crossways on the inking table.

MUSIC.

It is not necessary in this work to define what music is, nor enter
at all into any disquisition on the subject, as the object is the
printing of it only; and all that I shall attempt is to give the plan
of a pair of Music Cases, with the characters, and a specimen.

The English musical types have never to my knowledge undergone any
improvement, till within a few years, when Mr. Hughes cut two new
founts, which are looked upon as the best we have, and the largest of
which I have used for this article.

Mr. E. Cowper devised a plan for printing music, in which one page
was the lines only, and the other page was the notes, &c. only, and
the chase was prepared to turn upon a centre fixed in the table of a
press: thus the first impression was that of the lines without the
notes, &c. on one page, and the notes, &c. without the lines on the
other; the form was then turned half round, and the second impression
was, the lines on the notes on one page, and the notes on the lines
on the other. There is an objection to this plan for good work, which
is, that the page of notes requires a different making ready to the
page of lines, and when the two are completed they will be unequal
in the effect, for either the lines will be too strong, or the notes
have too little impression.

Mr. R. Branston struck out a different mode: he produced his music
by the usual process for printing it with the rolling press, only
the punches were struck deeper in the plate, and he then took a
stereotype plate from it in type metal, and after the white parts
were blocked out the music was sufficiently in relief to be printed
at the type press. Both these plans were adopted to preserve the
continuity of the lines, which in types got rounded off by wear where
they joined, and spoiled the appearance.

In distributing music, the compositor should be careful not to injure
the corners of the lines.


_Music of the Presses._ When a house has sufficient business to
employ all the presses within it, and a master printer walks through
his press room when they are all at work, and hears the creaking of
the heads, the thumping of the balls, the noise of the running in
and out of the carriage, and all the other miscellaneous, and, to
unaccustomed ears, discordant noises, he styles them the music of the
presses, which he declares to be the finest music in the world, as it
brings grist to his mill.


_The Music of the Presses,_ before the introduction of cylindrical
machines worked by steam engines, was a standing toast after dinner
at all parties among printers; and I hope it will never be neglected.

NAMES, ANCIENT, OF CITIES AND TOWNS.

The names distinguished by an asterisk * and an obelisk † were taken
from Dr. Adam Clarke’s Bibliographical Miscellany, where they form
two lists. The additional names were collected by myself.

In the towns marked * printing was carried on in the fifteenth
century; and Dr. A. Clarke says--“In this List, great care has been
taken not to omit one place where printing was carried on prior to
the year 1500.”--“In this list, because the name refers to the work
executed there, the genitive case has been retained. Panzer in his
list has followed the same plan. This will be of some use to the mere
English scholar, as he will at once see the same form of the word in
its alphabetical order in this list, which he finds in the title of
his book.”

In the towns marked † printing has been established and carried on
since the fifteenth century, and Dr. A. Clarke observes--“This part
might have been much enlarged, but it was not judged indispensably
necessary. As the most difficult names are here explained, which
usually occur in the titles of books, the residue it is hoped will
occasion little embarrassment to any scholar.”--“It may be necessary
to observe, for the information of the less experienced reader, that
in this Supplement, as the Latin name stands in reference to no
printed work, the nominative case has been always used.”

NEWSPAPERS.

The following report on the regular mode of working on Newspapers,
contains much interesting information respecting this branch of the
printing business.

I feel gratified in being able to give a copy of it, as it is
little known beyond the circle of the newspaper department, and
I am satisfied it will prove serviceable to the trade at large,
for newspapers are now frequently printed in book houses, where
the regulations connected with them are not generally known: and
I also think I am acting in accordance with the motives of the
Committee that drew it up, in giving it more publicity; for they
say, a Committee was appointed “to draw up, and circulate, for the
information of the trade, a statement of the regular mode of working
on newspapers--‘to guide the ignorant, to guard the unwary;’ to
assist them in their labours, and to maintain that harmony which
should ever subsist between two branches in one profession.” And,
“your Committee have extracted from, or inserted at length, every
document relating to regulations or prices since 1785, which they
trust will not be considered uninteresting, and, handed down as
records, may yet be useful.”


  “REPORT

  “Of a Committee appointed to draw up a Statement of the regular
  Mode of working on Newspapers, for the Information of the Trade;
  to examine Documents, and to report the same.--_Read July_ 29,
  1820.

  “THE object which your Committee were directed to accomplish
  (that of giving a fair scale of work, mode, time, and price,
  on _all Newspapers_, wherever published) has been entered into
  with zeal on their parts, and they trust will be found to your
  satisfaction. They have examined the bases of all official
  agreements, and all acknowledged and understood rules; and
  have particularly adhered to their instructions, by keeping in
  view, ‘that it was to guide the ignorant, to prevent the evil
  intentions of the unprincipled, and, if possible, to form a
  closer bond of union among yourselves.’

  “Laws are rendered more sacred, more valid, by age; and in
  performance of the task assigned them, the Committee commenced
  their labours by tracing the Regulations for News Work back to a
  certain period, in order to support them in their declaration,
  that they had been introduced on fair principles, that they
  had been cordially agreed to by the Masters, had been acted
  upon by the employed for so great a length of time, and that
  any innovation made on those regulations by an employer, or
  _set of men_ acting for themselves, without the concurrence of
  the general body of News Compositors, should be opposed, and
  those concerned in such an attempt treated as enemies to their
  fellow-workmen, and marked as acting inimically to the interests
  of their profession.

  “It was necessary for your Committee, for the maintenance of
  the superstructure, to examine its foundation; with this view
  they have, from oral testimony, been enabled to collect the size
  and price of various Newspapers from 1770. They consisted of 16
  small columns, some 18, some 19, and others 20 ems Long Primer
  wide. The galley was 130 or 132 lines, and 50 _after-lines_,
  Long Primer; Brevier galley 96, _after-lines_ 38. (The only
  exception was the old _Daily Advertiser_, which contained 12
  columns of 25 ems Long Primer wide, the galley in proportion.)
  The prices were, full hands 27_s._; supernumeraries 13_s._;
  galley 2_s._ 2_d._; 5_d._ per thousand; and _over hours_ 6_d._
  _Supernumeraries_ (a term which explains itself) were not known
  ten years prior to this date. Most of the papers were small
  folios; and as they were nearly all connected with, or done in
  Book-houses, the eldest apprentice, upon a press of matter,
  was usually called in to assist. Upon the subdivision of the
  labour into galleys, and the size of the papers extending, a man
  was employed if any deficiency arose in the quantity required.
  Advertisements increased; the use of small type was extended, and
  the _Supernumerary_ became a fixture.

  “Prior to 1776, controversial essays, domestic news, and extracts
  from the official communications in the London Gazette, appear to
  have filled the small columns of the Journals; but the American
  war commencing this year, they assumed a new consequence,
  by first venturing to give daily Reports of the Debates in
  Parliament.

  “In 1777 there were seven Morning Papers, eight of three times,
  one twice a week, and two weekly. The first _Sunday Paper_ came
  out in 1778; in a few weeks it was followed by a second: and a
  third was brought out in the succeeding year. The weekly Journals
  paid 24_s._ In 1780 a new Daily Journal arose, with a different
  appearance from the others, which seems to have induced a further
  alteration. The prices remained the same, but the employment of
  more hands was rendered necessary. The hour of beginning varied,
  some commencing business at eleven, others at two, and some so
  late as three o’clock.

  “In 1784, the first year after the peace, another Journal started
  for public favour, in which Minion was introduced. The old method
  of display was discarded, a new taste appeared in the arrangement
  of the matter in the inner form, and the former advertisement
  style was completely exploded. Rivalry commenced, and the other
  Newspapers soon made a correspondent change. Your Committee have
  thus reached the period when they meet with the first printed
  document relating to the composing part of the printing business.
  It is a request, in the form of a Circular, by the _body_ of
  Compositors, for an advance of _one halfpenny_ (Book-work being
  then paid 4_d._ per 1000), dated April 6, 1785, and consisting of
  eight propositions; which were not finally determined upon by the
  Employers till the 25th of November following. The proposition
  and answer relating to News-work were as follow:

  “‘PROP. 4. That the Compositors employed on Daily Newspapers,
  now paid at the rate of 27_s._ per week, be in future paid 1_l._
  11_s._ 6_d._ per week, and over hours paid as at present--_Answ._
  This cannot be a matter of general regulation, as the trouble of
  every paper differs from that of another.’

  “Your Committee have no other document of this date: it will be
  observed that the prices were low, and that the over hours were
  paid for; but it was considered impossible to make the request
  ‘a matter of general regulation,’ as every Journal differed in
  its trouble from another. The Book-men, however, received an
  advance of one-eighth, or 2_s._ 6_d._ in the pound, and the
  establishments in Book-houses varied from 1_l._ 1_s._ to 1_l._
  7_s._

  “1786.--The advance on Book-work commenced on the 1st of January,
  and in the month of March following the Newsmen, on Daily Papers
  only, received a rise of 4_s._ 6_d._, which made the price for
  full hands 1_l._ 11_s._ 6_d._, and for Supernumeraries 15_s._;
  the galley 2_s._ 6_d._ A few Journals only of the other class
  rose to 27_s._ At this time there were eight Morning Papers,
  eight of three times a week, two Weekly, and three Sunday
  Journals. In 1788 the first _Daily_ Evening Paper made its
  appearance, and the men received the same price as the Morning
  Papers; a second came out in 1791, and was paid in like manner.

  “1793.--For a number of years the Compositors employed on
  Book-work had been labouring under an intolerable grievance, and
  although they did not demand a rise per thousand, requested, as
  a new regulation, that the head and direction lines of pages,
  and the en and em quadrats at the sides, should be paid for.
  Their Circular was dated the 14th January, and on the 11th March
  following, the masters agreed to the proposition of paying the
  head and direction lines, but not the ens and ems.

  “The News department appears to have been in full employment at
  this period. By a strong competition for public favour (which
  commenced, as already observed, prior to the termination of the
  American war, and from the year 1785 to 1793), the Journals
  underwent a most material alteration. It was a remarkable epoch,
  including the most eventful seven years of the last century.
  The disarrangements, both civil and political, concomitant to
  a return to peace after a long war--the wars in India--the
  troubles in Germany, in Flanders, Brabant, Holland--the French
  Revolution--and the commencement of a war with France--all
  occurring within the dates just mentioned, caused a strong
  political feeling in the public mind; of course, information
  from all quarters was eagerly sought, and as readily given by
  the Editors of the Daily Journals, among whom, as with their
  readers, party spirit rose to its utmost height, and no expence
  was spared to gratify it. In this period nineteen _new_ journals
  put forth their claims for public support--the majority,
  however, were ‘born but to die!’--two of the older Papers also
  expired; but their places were occupied by _seven_ juniors. The
  number now amounted to eleven Morning and two Evening Papers;
  seven of three times a week, one Weekly, and five Sunday papers.
  An alteration in the method of display, and a new mode in the
  arrangement of the matter, became now very general. One Journal
  went beyond the rest, by its introduction of French rules, the
  small capitals for particular paragraphs, and discarding nearly
  all the double letters, and the _long s_. Your Committee are
  also enabled to state, by comparing the modes of work prior to
  1785, with the necessary alterations at the period they have
  now mentioned, that a complete revolution was also effected in
  the _nature_ of News-work. It became necessary, therefore, that
  the price should keep pace with the labour, and an advance was
  solicited. The first printed document, _solely_ from Newsmen, is
  dated April 4, 1793, signed by 145 Newsmen, and their request
  was supported by the signatures of 281 Bookmen. It contains four
  propositions:--the first for an advance of 4_s._ 6_d._ per week
  on _Morning_ and _Evening_ papers; the second related to the
  _hours_ of working and the charge for _over-hours_, which then
  was but 6_d._ per hour; the third, to Papers published _three
  times a week_; and the fourth, to supernumeraries, but it did not
  state their price. All these propositions were modified ten years
  afterwards.

  “The address which accompanied these propositions, and the
  requests made in it, being so applicable to the present mode of
  work, your Committee are satisfied with defending every iota
  requited by their predecessors. Although twenty-seven years
  have elapsed since they were submitted to the employers, yet,
  if required at the present moment, the same arguments might be
  used in their support. In fact, they must be considered the
  foundation-stones of the edifice. Your Committee will introduce
  the document.


                                           “_London, April 4, 1793._
  “‘SIR,

  “‘The Compositors employed on Newspapers, impressed with the
  opinion of your candour in hearing and redressing any real
  grievances they may complain of, presume to submit to your
  consideration the following statement:

  “‘Previous to the year 1786, the weekly salary of _Daily_
  Newspaper Compositors was 1_l._ 7_s._, a sum which, considering
  the regularity and moderation of the hours of attendance, was
  thought fully adequate to their trouble. Owing, however, to a
  competition for Public favour among the various newspapers,
  by giving a long detail of Parliamentary Debates, entering at
  large into the politics of Europe, and the irregularity and
  uncertainty of the arrival of mails, the hours of attendance were
  necessarily increased, which, together with the enhanced price of
  Provisions, made an advance of salary necessary, and which was at
  that time cheerfully acquiesced in by the Proprietors of _Daily_
  Newspapers, as perfectly reasonable; but no advance was then
  given to _Evening_ Papers.

  “‘The Compositors on both _Daily_ and _Evening Papers_, upon a
  comparative view of the trouble and attendance requisite at that
  period and at the present time, and the still increased price of
  the necessaries of life, humbly propose and request an addition
  to their Salary, which they trust the Gentlemen Proprietors
  of Newspapers will not think unreasonable, when the following
  circumstances are taken into consideration:

  “‘That at the rate of twelve hours’ Composition, and at least two
  hours’ Distribution, the present Salary of Compositors employed
  on _Daily Papers_ amounts to no more than Fourpence Halfpenny
  an hour, which, considering the irregular hours of attendance,
  working by night, and on Sundays, and of being constantly at
  command, the Compositors humbly think, and trust, the Gentlemen
  Proprietors of Newspapers will agree with them in opinion is by
  no means adequate to their labour.

  “‘That as Compositors on _Evening Papers_ obtained no advance
  in the year 1786, and that as their labour has been gradually
  increasing ever since that time, it is hoped their joining in the
  present application will not be thought unreasonable.

  “‘It is humbly proposed, for the above reasons, that an increase
  should take place upon the Salaries of Compositors on Newspapers,
  in the following proportion, viz.

  “‘I. That an advance of 4_s._ 6_d._ per week take place on the
  present Salary of every Compositor fully employed on _Daily
  Papers_.

  “‘II. That if, owing to the length of Proceedings in Parliament,
  or other late Matter, the Compositors employed on Daily Papers
  should be detained above twelve hours on Saturday, to be reckoned
  from the time of beginning to compose on Friday, they be paid
  Sixpence per hour extra for the same, or an equal proportion of
  time allowed on Sunday, in the same manner as is usual on other
  Days of the Week.

  “‘III. That 3_s._ be added to the present Weekly Salary of
  Compositors fully employed on _Evening Papers published three
  times a week_.

  “‘IV. That the Salary of Supernumeraries employed on either of
  the above be increased in proportion.

  “‘These, Sir, are the propositions submitted to you, to be laid
  before the Gentlemen Proprietors, not doubting but that the
  reasonableness of the Compositors’ demands will be evident to
  you, and that it will meet with your approbation and concurrence,
  especially when it is considered that the advance they require is
  so nearly proportionate to that lately obtained on Book-work.’

  “It will be necessary to state that the terms _Evening Papers_
  used in this document, allude only to the desire expressed in the
  third proposition. The words _Daily Newspapers_, repeated in the
  second and fourth paragraphs of the Address, and in the first
  proposition, sufficiently show that no distinction was intended
  to be made between _Daily Morning_ and _Daily Evening Papers_.
  But this request of the Newsmen did not seem to be answered with
  cordiality by the Masters, for your Committee have a copy of
  the Report of the News Committee, dated April 20, 1793, which,
  after mentioning the names of 15 Delegates present, at two in the
  afternoon, previous to the general meeting to be held at seven in
  the evening, states

  “‘That, pursuant to a printed circular Letter, signed ‘JOHN
  BELL,’ the Committee adjourn to Anderton’s Coffee-house, to hold
  a conference as requested, on some Propositions laid before
  the Printers and Proprietors of Newspapers, by the Journeymen
  employed by them.--Adjourned accordingly.

  “‘That the above-mentioned _John Bell_, instead of attending to

  particularly _advantageous_ to the Employers and _Employed_, viz.


                                                 “‘_April 20, 1793._

  “‘Considering the Requisitions and Pretensions of the Newspaper
  Compositors in the most extensive and liberal Points of View,
  so far as they are connected with the fair Interests of their
  Employers, it was resolved, to recommend the Prices and
  Regulations in future for Newspaper work to be fixed on the
  following Plan:

  “‘That each regular Compositor be paid One Pound Fourteen
  Shillings _per_ Week.

  “‘That the Hours of regular Attendance for composing, be from
  Three o’Clock in the Afternoon until the Paper goes to Press.

  “‘That the Supernumerary Compositors shall be allowed one
  Shilling _per_ Week over and above their present Pay, supposing
  that such Supernumerary shall compose _one Column_ per _Day_, and

  “‘That your Delegates, with a becoming Dignity, rejected the
  Resolutions of the said _John Bell_.

  “‘That your Delegates, from the Consideration of the Labour
  required, find their first Proposition unanswered, unopposed, and
  therefore just.’


                                               “‘_Ten o’Clock_, P.M.

  “‘The GENERAL MEETING unanimously approve of the Conduct of the
  Delegation; and further resolve,

  “‘That the Original Propositions standing uncontroverted, the
  same be strictly adhered to.’

  “The Resolution in the last paragraph of this Report was most
  rigidly adhered to; and your Committee cannot but lament,
  that the first attempt of your brethren to introduce _Laws
  and Regulations_ for the reciprocal benefit of the employer
  and employed, was met by such proposition on the part of one
  Proprietor, that, in order to carry their point, they were
  obliged to enter into a Resolution that a general notice of
  quitting their situations, according to the custom of the trade,
  should be given. Before the expiration of the fortnight, however,
  an accommodation was proposed by the Employers individually;
  but upon the principle that a material difference existed, both
  in labour and comfort, between an Evening and a Morning Paper,
  the Newsmen agreed to a distinction being made in the price.
  Morning Papers received the sum required of 4_s._ 6_d._, but
  Evening Papers only 2_s._ 6_d._ The wages of the former were
  1_l._ 16_s._; Supernumeraries 17_s._; the galley 2_s._ 10_d._:
  the Evening Papers were 34_s._; Supernumeraries 16_s._; the
  galley 2_s._ 8_d._ Within this period the term _Assistants_ was
  first recognized. Your Committee are not enabled to state whether
  any satisfactory agreement was entered into with respect to the
  second Proposition of the Journeymen relating to the commencing
  work on Sundays. It would appear that they only requested that
  day’s indulgence, for they already possessed it on the others.
  Some of the Journals at this time paid but 6_d._ per hour, while
  others, more liberal, paid on those of the Morning 7½_d._ and on
  the Evening 7_d._ for over-hours or Assistants.

  “In the month of October, 1793, the same year of the rise,
  your Committee find that the Journeymen had occasion, from the
  accumulation of labour on Daily Newspapers, to object to the
  employment of Apprentices, as a strong desire was evinced,
  at this period, of returning to the system, by employing
  _run-aways_, or _turn-overs_, as they were denominated. The
  Employers conceiving they had been _forced_ to accede to the
  rise in the month of April preceding, appeared determined to
  take advantage of the men, by paying themselves for their defeat
  by the difference of price between Apprentices and Journeymen.
  Suspicion had been long awake that some innovation was intended,
  and the scheme soon developed itself; the Newsmen assembled,
  and entered into certain Resolutions, which, with a statement
  of their case, were sent round the Trade for the concurrence
  or disapproval of the Bookmen. They were readily adopted by
  the latter, and your Committee present an Extract from the
  Journeymen’s Address, and their Resolutions.


                                                “‘_October 1, 1793._

  “‘Can any reasonable Advocate be found for the Introduction
  of Apprentices on Newspapers? We do not believe there can.--A
  Companionship on a Newspaper, distinct and different in its
  Nature from Book-work, requires equal Attention, equal Exertion,
  and equal Interest. And can this be expected (we ask) from an
  Apprentice? Companionships find it their mutual interest to be
  watchful over each other, and see that each does an equal share;
  which, if not done, is easily remedied among themselves. But
  who is it that will say this can be done with an Apprentice? A
  Journeyman must be attentive, or, from the Representations of his
  Companions, he loses his situation. But how is this to take place
  in regard to Apprentices? If complaints are made to the Printer,
  how can he rectify them? It is evident to us that he cannot. Your
  time of employment is not to be forced on an Apprentice; he can
  refuse to work either by Night or on Sunday, and be justified
  in his refusal; and Magistrates _must_ sanction him. Indeed,
  experience has proved that it is generally impossible to keep an
  Apprentice to the Business on a Newspaper with regularity; they
  have no interest to bind them; they have no obligation to compel
  them. Need there be a further Argument used in support of our
  opinion? We trust not. Under these circumstances, then, there is
  only one thing remaining for us to recommend--to unite in a firm
  Phalanx, and to be _unanimous_.’


  “‘RESOLUTIONS.

  “‘I. That Newspaper printing, being necessarily conducted
  by Companionships, requires in each Companion corresponding
  abilities, corresponding modes of reasoning, and corresponding
  interests.

  “‘II. That an Apprentice, not being at liberty to act for
  himself, cannot be supposed to possess an equal and independent
  mode of reasoning, and therefore has not a corresponding interest.

  “‘III. That the introduction of an Apprentice upon a Newspaper
  will occasion a clashing of interests, which may, in the end,
  prove highly detrimental, not only to the Companionship, but to
  the Property on which they are engaged, and likewise to the whole
  body of Compositors, by enlarging the field for the employment of
  Apprentices.

  “‘IV. That therefore the Compositors on Newspapers are firmly
  and decidedly of opinion, that an Apprentice is by no means an
  adequate Companion.

  “‘V. And therefore they will resist, to the utmost of their
  power, any attempt (if any such attempt should happen) to obtrude
  an Apprentice upon them.’

  “The system, however, commenced in the month of October, upon
  one Journal, which lasted about five years--and upon another
  which continued nearly eleven years; but in the end you were
  successful; and men were again engaged upon these Journals on a
  fair principle. The fate of some who had worked with the boys
  should have served as a warning--they were neglected, despised,
  and ultimately driven from the profession. Your Committee cannot
  refrain from congratulating the Journeymen of that period on
  their unanimity and perseverance; and at this moment, upon a due
  consideration of the present state of our business, rejoice in
  their patriotism, and return thanks to every individual now in
  being concerned in the opposition given to the attempt.

  “1801.]--Your Committee have thus led you to the conclusion of
  the second period of seven years, through the whole of which
  the country was engaged in a war with nearly all the European
  quarter of the globe, and, as has been stated for 1793, your
  labour increased with the demand for news by the public, and
  by the struggles of the Journals for pre-eminence, which,
  added to the alarming price of provisions and all other family
  requisites, made it again necessary to solicit an advance of
  wages. In the month of November, 1800, the Book-men requested a
  rise, and certain regulations applicable to their department. It
  was granted to the amount of 1-6th, and took place on the 1st
  of January, 1801. Shortly after, almost gratuitously, the News
  department received an advance of 1-9th (or 4_s._) on Morning,
  and 1-11th (or 3_s._) on Evening Papers. The former were now
  2_l._; Supernumeraries 19_s._; per galley 3_s._ 2_d._; Assistants
  9½_d._ per hour; the Evening, 1_l._ 17_s._; Supernumeraries
  17_s._; per galley 2_s._ 10_d._; Assistants 8½_d._ per hour.

  “Thus terminated the third rise from 1785. In this period several
  disputes occurred; but your Committee will only repeat those
  relating to the general interest. From the extensive sale of some
  of the Evening Papers, the work was obliged to be performed in a
  manner that, from its evil tendency, required some modification;
  the hours for composition were not so well defined as hereafter
  they appear to have been, and the following Resolution, as
  applicable to Evening Papers, was agreed to among the Newsmen;
  ‘That all composition cease when the day’s publication goes to
  press--all work afterwards to be paid for as extra, or deducted
  from the first work of the next publication.’ This did not apply
  to the second or third editions of the day’s paper; that being
  completed, those _additions_ could have no claim on the following
  publication. The quantity and quality of the matter were also
  better defined within this period. Brevier was the smallest type
  till 1784, when Minion was introduced; and the adequate number of
  lines, by their proportion to Long Primer and width of column,
  were regulated by the Companionships and their _Printers_.
  This continued till 1793, when the different proportions were
  _generally_ understood, and a printed graduated Scale for Long
  Primer, Brevier, and Minion, according to width, was found
  in each News-house. This appears to have been requisite, as
  your Committee learn, that, from 1789, it was the custom on
  some Journals to widen their columns, during the sitting of
  Parliament, one or two ems, and reducing them in the recess.
  At this date a misunderstanding still existed relative to the
  hour of beginning on Sundays. Certain regulations were adopted
  respecting the twelve hours’ work (including refreshment time,
  galley and ‘_lines_,’ and correcting), and the time of commencing
  on that day.--Your Committee must observe, that the Compositors
  employed on Morning Papers at this period were not uniform in
  their hours of beginning on Sundays, and disputes frequently
  occurred on that point. This might have arisen from the different
  _temper_ and _politics_ of the Journals on which they were
  engaged; some entering at length on the Friday night’s Debates
  in Parliament, Foreign News, &c., while others were content
  with giving the Public a moderate portion of both. Competition,
  however, soon made the labour on the Journals equal, and, in
  1803, the hour of commencing on the Sunday, regulated by the
  Saturday’s finish, became general.

  “Your Committee also state that they have endeavoured to trace
  the origin of what are termed the ‘_after-lines_’ of the first
  work; tradition has vaguely assisted them in their research.
  They learn that they were general in 1777, but differing in
  amount. The term is not mentioned in the Propositions of 1793,
  but is acknowledged in the Regulations before mentioned; your
  Committee are therefore led to conclude that they arose with the
  subdivision of labour on the smaller Papers, prior to 1770, and
  suppose that custom, arising from local convenience, sanctioned
  their adoption by your predecessors.

  “1809.]--In pursuing their plan, your Committee observe nothing
  of material consequence occurring in the News department till the
  year 1809, when the still-increasing price of provisions rendered
  it necessary for the Compositors to solicit a rise of prices, and
  on the 19th of May the Newsmen issued a Circular, addressed ‘To
  the Proprietors of Newspapers,’ requesting an advance of 1-5th on
  their wages,--_i. e._ 8_s._ per week on Morning, and 6_s._ per
  week on Evening Papers.

  “In the two former Circulars, certain propositions were
  submitted, to be accepted, modified, or rejected; but the present
  one was accompanied by the first and regular _Scale for News
  Work_, and signed by 198 Newsmen. Your Committee will introduce
  an extract from the introductory paragraphs and the Scale itself,
  which completed the edifice you had long laboured to rear.

  “After stating the necessity the Newsmen were under of soliciting
  the assistance of the Employers to enable them, by their
  industry, to make their existence comfortable, they point out the
  moderation of their request, by giving a comparative statement
  of the prices for family necessaries, between 1793 and 1809,
  by which it appeared, that in sixteen years they were nearly
  doubled. They further add, that

  “‘It has been observed by the Duke of Portland, in his letter
  to the Lord Lieutenant of Oxford, that ‘_there is no reason
  why the labour of the Handicraftsman, the Mechanic, and the
  Artizan, should not keep pace with the advance on the articles
  of the Farmer, Grazier,’ &c._ Upon this principle, the justice
  of which is too evident to need the smallest comment, might we
  not calculate, as Morning Papers, in 1793, were paid 36_s._, and
  Evening Papers 34_s._ that we should now receive nearly 3_l._
  12_s._ on the Morning Papers, instead of 2_l._; and nearly 3_l._
  8_s._ instead of 1_l._ 17_s._ on the Evening?

  “‘There is another consideration to which we must beg to call
  your attention; at the time of the last advance a ratio of
  one-sixth was obtained on all works in Book-houses, which
  proportion was not received by those employed on Newspapers; four
  shillings only being granted on Morning Papers, which before that
  time were 36_s._, and three shillings on Evening Papers, which
  previously were 34_s._, being only one-ninth on the former, and
  scarcely an eleventh on the latter. These circumstances, together
  with the great increase of labour on Papers of late years,
  arising from the introduction of _so large a portion of small
  letter_, are considerations which, we hope, will not be passed
  over without that deliberation they deserve.

  “‘From an impartial view of the comparative statements and the
  proposed advance, it will be seen that we have kept perfectly
  within the limits prescribed by justice. We have pursued this
  line of conduct from a solicitude to avoid the introduction of
  any thing which might prevent your ready compliance with our
  request.

  “‘PROPOSED SCALE.

  Daily Morning Papers to be paid            £2  8  0
  Per Galley on ditto                         0  3  9½
  Daily Evening Papers                        2  3  0

  “‘Papers Three Times a-Week, and Weekly Papers, to take an
  advance in proportion to that on Evening Papers.

  “‘☞ That the above advance do take place from Saturday the 3d of
  June, 1809.’

  “This request was verbally and negatively answered in the
  different News Houses, and the 3d of June passed over as if no
  solicitation for a rise of prices had been made. The Journeymen
  felt the necessity of perseverance, and the following Circular
  was sent to the Employers, dated June 13, signed by the same
  number of men:

  “‘GENTLEMEN,--We cannot help expressing our surprise at the
  manner in which our request has been passed over; nearly a
  month has elapsed, and no answer has been communicated. Had
  we in our Scale gone further than the urgency of the times
  renders necessary, or had we neglected to shew that respect
  which your situations in life require, we might have anticipated
  such indifference; but feeling our conduct not liable to such
  objection, we are entirely at a loss to assign any motive for
  the want of attention to our present circumstances; and we feel
  ourselves under the necessity of requesting an answer by Saturday
  next; a noncompliance with which will be considered as a refusal
  of our propositions.’

  “This second Circular received no answer, and on the 20th of
  June, the regular notice of quitting was given to the different
  Printers; but before the fortnight had elapsed, each Journeyman
  received a copy of a Report of a Committee of Masters, dated June
  30, accompanied by a string of Resolutions, but not meeting the
  request of the men.

  “Your Committee regret that the document is too voluminous for
  insertion, but they will make a few extracts in furtherance of
  their present object. It commences with stating, that ‘A General
  Meeting of the Proprietors of London Morning and Evening Papers
  was held this day (June 30, 1809), Mr. Stuart in the Chair, to
  take into consideration the Report of the Committee appointed to
  enquire into, and report their opinion upon the _Circular Letter_
  of the Compositors, respecting certain alleged grievances, and
  _demanding_ an advance of Wages; present five Daily Morning,
  and five Daily Evening Papers,’ and that the said Report was
  read.--To answer the above-mentioned ‘Circular Letter,’ eleven
  paragraphs are given, and a comparative Table of the Prices of
  Necessaries, from 1793 to 1809, in contradiction to that given in
  by the Journeymen.

  “The _first_ paragraph condemns the strong spirit evinced by
  the men in demanding so large a rise as 20 per cent. on their
  labour; and protests against the ‘Scale proposed,’ as containing
  ‘_Rules and Restrictions_ new to the Trade, and embarrassing to
  the Proprietors, while no reciprocal benefit or advantage is held
  out.’

  “The _second_ attempts to controvert the assertion of the
  Newsmen, that they ‘experienced difficulties in procuring the
  necessaries of life,’ by declaring it ‘a matter of surprise and
  regret, that any thing so unfounded should be advanced on so
  serious an occasion by a body of men, generally speaking, so
  intelligent and respectable;’ and after comparing your prices and
  situation with your Brethren on Book-work and other mechanics,
  conclude with stating, that

  “‘Their claims to high wages do not rest on the difficulties in
  obtaining the necessaries of life, but on the disagreeable hours
  of labour. They make more money than falls to the lot of 39-40ths
  of the men in Britain, and they can procure not only all the
  necessaries of life, but even _more of its comforts_, than 99
  out of every 100 men in Europe. It is lamentable to see men so
  insensible to the _blessings_ of their situation!’

  “Your Committee cannot congratulate you on the _comforts_ or
  _blessings_ of your situation; they leave to your own feelings
  the fallacy of assertions so hackneyed, and proceed to the
  _third_ paragraph, which calls the quotation from the ‘Duke
  of Portland’s Letter,’ a ‘misrepresentation, and a pretended
  extract,’ and concludes with finding a meaning not intended by
  his Grace of Portland--‘that the arbitrary fixing of wages was a
  most alarming evil.’

  “The _fourth_ respects the statement of the prices of
  necessaries, and will not admit the propriety of introducing the
  year 1793 in comparison with 1809, because the Compositors ‘then
  received all they asked, and a _new compact_ was formed with them
  on their own terms.’ A difference appears in the Compositors
  statement and that of your Employers, for the year 1793, of
  2½_d._!

  “The _fifth_ acknowledges the calculation for 1809 to be
  correct--10_s._ 4½_d._; and as the prices for 1800 were 8_s._
  9½_d_., there only remained a difference of 1_s._ 6¾_d._ to 1809;
  a loss they conceived you might well bear ‘without incurring the
  penalties of starvation.’

  “Your Committee feel it necessary to quote the _sixth_ at
  length;--it needs no comment.

  “‘The reference the Compositors make to the increased labour
  on Newspapers, in consequence of the introduction of _small
  letter_, is unjust, is absurd, and we cannot understand how
  they could allow so unfounded a complaint to escape them. The
  proprietors have always paid, and paid smartly too, for this
  introduction. The Compositors have limited hours of employment,
  limited quantities of work, and they _compose only one number of
  letters_, whether small or large, _agreeably to the universal
  rule of the business_.’

  “The _seventh_ mentions Apprentices, which your Committee will
  not repeat, considering that question set at rest.

  “The _eighth_ recommends that ‘the false assertions, groundless
  complaints, and extravagant pretensions of the Compositors
  should be met by a firm and determined resistance;’ and for fear
  that you should be intoxicated by success to demand ‘double
  wages,’ state, that they ‘have therefore considered a plan of
  establishing a society of Compositors under an Act of Parliament,
  connecting with it a benefit society, which, they are confident,
  will enable the trade to go on, and which they may hereafter
  submit to you;’ but without stating who were to be the _honoured_
  Members of such society.

  “The _ninth_ paragraph, after expressing the indignance of the
  Masters at the extravagant demands of the men, recommends that
  the wages should be put upon a footing with Book-work in 1800;
  acknowledging that the rise on the latter was 1-6th, while that
  on News-work was but 1-9th on Morning, and 1-11th on Evening
  Papers, and propose that 2_s._ per week should be added to the
  Morning Papers, but that only 1_s._ should be given to the
  Evening Papers, ‘the difference in the labour and hours of work
  being much more than 4_s._ per week.’

  “The _tenth_ recommends that no alteration in the hours of
  composition on Evening Papers be permitted.

  “The _eleventh_ expresses the anxiety of the Committee to give
  the Compositors a detailed answer, in order that the latter might
  clearly understand and appreciate their own interests; and the
  whole concludes with the following


  “‘RESOLUTIONS.

  “‘_Resolved_,--That the Report of the Committee now read be
  agreed to.

  “‘_Resolved_,--That the Newspaper Compositors have not made out a
  case entitling them to a rise of wages; but that as they complain
  their rise in 1800 was not equal to the rise in Book Houses, a
  Regulation do now take place, putting them both on a footing.

  “‘_Resolved_,--That as the labour on Morning is considerably
  heavier than on Evening Papers, the latter are not entitled to
  the same indulgence on this occasion as the former.

  “‘_Resolved_,--That from Saturday the 15th of July, 1809, the
  wages of Compositors on Daily Morning Papers shall be two Guineas
  per week, and on daily Evening Papers Thirty-eight Shillings;
  and that the Galley on the former shall be Three Shillings and
  Four-pence, on the latter Three Shillings and Two-pence.

  “‘_Resolved_,--That the Circular Letter of the Journeymen
  Compositors, together with the Report of the Committee of Masters
  and these Resolutions, signed by the Chairman, be printed in the
  form of a letter, and that some one Proprietor of each Newspaper
  shall personally deliver to each Compositor, while at work in his
  house, a Copy of the said printed Letter.

                                  (Signed)    “‘D. STUART, CHAIRMAN.


  “‘_Turk’s Head Coffee House, Strand_,
  _June_ 30, 1809.’

  “After some discussion, the Newsmen agreed to accept the offer
  made by the Proprietors in the Resolution above stated; but
  as the sums given were declared to be on the principle only
  of putting you on an _equality_ with the Bookmen, in their
  advance in 1801, it was determined to continue united to support
  the original Propositions when an opportunity offered. This
  regulation gave the Morning Papers 2_l._ 2_s._; Supernumeraries
  1_l._; per galley 3_s._ 4_d._; 10_d._ per hour; and Evening
  Papers 1_l._ 18_s._; Supernumeraries 19_s._; per galley 3_s._
  2_d._; 9_d._ per hour.

  “At this period the Book Compositors were soliciting a rise of
  1-7th on their prices. The Newsmen were not long behind their
  brethren in claiming the same advance on their labour, and the
  long Report of the Masters, before mentioned, was answered,
  paragraph by paragraph, in a manner which must have convinced
  them, that if they would not allow the talent, they must
  acknowledge that all the justice in the dispute lay on your side.
  This answer is dated January 18, 1810. Your Committee cannot, in
  consequence of its length, insert it here, but, to suit their
  present purpose, will extract the answers to the _second_ and
  _fifth_ paragraphs.

  “‘The profession of a man should be always equal to the support
  of himself and his family in a decent way. They should be
  supplied with not merely what will preserve animation, but what
  custom has rendered necessary for our comfort; and every man of
  family must feel the truth of the assertion--that at the present
  time he experiences difficulty in procuring such necessaries.
  With respect to the difference between the wages of Book and News
  Compositors, it will be observed, that the expences of a News
  Compositor are necessarily more than that of a Book Compositor,
  arising from the unseasonable hours of labour.--We believe the
  latter part of their paragraph will be found very deficient of
  truth; for there are but few mechanics with the same constant and
  regular exertion, but would equal, and exceed by far our incomes.’

  “As the two dates given by the Journeymen for the prices of
  provisions were to be contradicted, they introduced _three_
  tables, and made a calculation by the rule of Subtraction.
  But the men were not to be deceived by this _new_ system of
  Arithmetic, and combated by the _old_ mode as follows:

  “‘_It would seem as if the sum of 1s. 6¾d. was considered as
  the loss we sustained in the course of a week; but it is the
  proportion it bears to 8s. 9½d.; and we find that it makes a
  difference in our weekly incomes of 7s. 1d., a sum which must be
  felt particularly by those having families._’

  “The assertions made in the other paragraphs were most ably
  controverted, and your cause made doubly sure by the truths
  which accompanied its defence. The Employers never made a reply
  to it, because it was unanswerable; and your Committee cannot
  refrain from expressing their gratitude to all concerned in its
  production.

  “1810.]--To proceed. The Book Masters acquiesced in the request
  of their Compositors for an advance, which was to take place
  on the 1st of May, and the Newsmen taking advantage of the
  acknowledgment made in the _ninth_ paragraph before mentioned,
  demanded the rise of 1-7th to place them on an equality with
  their brethren in the Book department. Their request was not
  noticed. They still persevered, and to assist their cause the
  Bookmen came to a Resolution, that no man should apply for a
  situation on a Newspaper during the dispute.--Highly to their
  credit, and honourable to their character, not one application
  was made.

  “The Newsmen still continued their exertions, and, on the 14th
  of May, the following proposition in MS. was presented to each
  Companionship:--

  “‘_The Proprietors of the Daily Newspapers, having taken the
  request of their Compositors for an advance of wages into
  consideration, and on_ referring to the whole series of rises
  from 1783{5}, _when Bookwork was 4d. per thousand, and Morning
  Papers were 1l. 7s. per week, find that 2l. 0s. 6d. on Morning
  Papers would be equal to 6d. per thousand, the present advanced
  price on Book-work._

  “‘_But the Proprietors unwilling wholly to disappoint the
  expectations of their Compositors, consent to give them an
  advance of 4s. on Morning Papers, and 3s. on Evening Papers, per
  week, making the wages on Morning Papers 2l. 6s. per man per
  week, and on Daily Evening Papers 2l. 1s.; to take place from
  Monday, May 21, 1810._’

  “This was answered by the following Resolutions:

  “‘At a General Meeting of the Compositors employed on Newspapers,
  held May 19, 1810, the following declarative Resolutions were
  agreed to _unanimously_:--

  “‘Res. I. That in tracing our advances of wages from the year
  1783{5} up to 1800, there not being extant any clear and certain
  records, and a perfect collection of documents containing all
  the circumstances, many important facts and transactions may be
  forgotten and lost.

  “‘Res. II. That from the above consideration, it is evident, that
  to refer further back than 1800, in order to determine what ought
  to be the advance of wages on Newspapers, is unfair and improper;
  and it is contrary to right, according to the declared opinions
  of the Newspaper Proprietors themselves, as expressed (in a
  Report of their Committee, dated June 30, 1809, and generally
  circulated) in the following words of their own: ‘The Compositors
  have no right to refer further back than the year 1800, as they
  then received all they asked, and a _new compact_ was made with
  them on their own terms.’

  “‘Res. III. That the Newspaper Proprietors ought to give their
  Compositors an advance of wages fully equal to the advance on
  Bookwork since 1800, conformably to the principle admitted by
  themselves in the above-mentioned document: where, after stating
  the allegation of the Newspaper Compositors that their advance in
  1800 was not equal to the advance on Bookwork, and admitting the
  fact, they allow it to be (using their own words) a reasonable
  ground of complaint in your Compositors Circular.

  “‘Res. IV. That, in the Scale of 1805, a considerable advance was
  granted to the Compositors on Bookwork in respect to Sunday-work,
  Night-work, and Morning-work, which required a correspondent
  advance on Newspapers, to which it is particularly applicable.

  “‘Res. V. That, even if we had not the above indisputable
  grounds, we have in justice sufficient grounds in the exigencies
  of the times, as, according to the News Proprietors own statement
  of the comparative prices of the necessaries of life between 1800
  and 1809, there was a rise of 1_s._ 6¾_d._ on 8_s._ 9½_d._, which
  makes a difference in our weekly incomes (taking the medium of
  Morning and Evening Papers) of upwards of 7_s._

  “‘Res. VI. That the Compositors on Bookwork have received less
  from their Employers than their exigencies required, and only
  what circumstances allowed. Those unfavourable circumstances were
  alleged to arise principally from the war, and, consequently, far
  from being applicable to the Newspaper branch of the Business,
  which derives its prosperity from the war. Therefore, there could
  be no reason why Compositors employed on Newspapers should not
  have an advance fully adequate to their exigencies.’

  “A fortnight’s notice to quit was then given upon the Daily
  Papers, and on the day of its expiration the News Compositors
  were given to understand from the individual Printers, that the
  demand was acquiesced in, and your Scale, as it now stands,
  was acknowledged--Morning Papers 2_l._ 8_s._; Supernumeraries
  1_l._ 3_s._; galley 3_s._ 10_d._; 9_d._ per thousand; and
  Assistants 11½_d._ per hour.--Evening Papers 2_l._ 3_s._ 6_d._;
  Supernumeraries 1_l._ 1_s._ 6_d._; galley 3_s._ 7_d._; 8½_d._ per
  thousand; and Assistants 10½_d._ per hour.

  “Thus terminated your last struggle. It will be found that
  in the space of twenty-four years, your prices and modes of
  work have equally changed with the appearance of the Journals.
  From the former rise to the present nothing appears worthy
  notice, excepting the alteration of measure during the sitting
  of Parliament; but from the great pressure of matter, and an
  alteration in the size of paper used, most of the Journals
  retained the same measure during the recess.

  “Your Committee feel that some apology may be necessary for
  giving so minute a detail of what perhaps has occurred within
  your own memory; but the task imposed upon them embracing so
  wide a field, must plead their excuse; and having introduced the
  latter document to your notice, considering it the precursor of
  an understood and established ‘Scale of Prices,’ they trust its
  utility will compensate for the trespass.

  “Having now advanced to the period (May, 1810) when your
  endeavours, after twelve months’ struggle, were crowned with
  success, your Committee, trusting to your own feelings, must beg
  to pause on the events of that time.”

[Then follow some observations which are not relevant to the present
work, nor to the tracing of the history of prices, nor to the
management of Newspapers in the metropolis.]

  “In the year 1811, a dispute occurred on an Evening Paper,
  respecting the introduction of Apprentices, which lasted but six
  weeks.

  “About the year 1813, Morning Papers of 20 columns became almost
  general. Papers of the present size have not rendered the use of
  small type less necessary than when they consisted but of sixteen
  columns; and the remarks made in the extracts from the documents
  before your Committee, of the years 1793-1810, are equally
  applicable as the same causes exist.

  “In the commencement of the year 1816, the Trade was thrown into
  confusion by the introduction of Nonpareil, a type not recognised
  in former agreements respecting the price of Newspapers. The
  Companionship were required to compose it at Minion price and
  quantity; they refused, and in consequence left their situations;
  but others, in direct opposition to the interests of the
  profession, submitted to the demand. Ignorance could not be
  pleaded by them; for your Committee are well aware, that few men
  can be found incapable of casting up the galley on a Newspaper,
  or be unacquainted with the difference in price of Nonpareil and
  other types used in Book-houses. The bad example set by these
  men, with the desire of gain, may have induced others to follow
  their steps; but they cannot, unless you lose your unanimity, sap
  the foundation of your rights. It is therefore incumbent on your
  Committee to protest against any men taking upon themselves the
  right of deviating from your regulations, or of settling either
  the price or quantity of the galley of smaller type than Minion,
  without a general understanding with their brethren of the
  profession. It has caused both trouble and expense, and been the
  means of removing good men to gratify the meanness or greediness
  of those, who have in the end been necessitated to throw
  themselves upon the mercy of their fellow-workmen, for permission
  to gain a subsistence among those they had, by their previous
  conduct, deprived of bread. Your Committee beg to state, that
  adding the difference in price given on Nonpareil or Pearl in
  Book-work to the price per thousand in News-work, will be found
  the equitable charge for those sizes; that is, 1_d._ per thousand
  extra on Nonpareil, and 2_d._ on Pearl. Thus the fair charge for
  Nonpareil on Morning Papers would be 10_d._ per thousand, Evening
  Papers 9½, Pearl, 11_d._ per thousand on Morning and 10½ on
  Evening Papers--or a _reduction, in proportion to value, on the
  galley quantity_.

  “In the latter end of the same year a misunderstanding arose in
  consequence of a Morning and Evening Paper being done in the
  same place. It might have been considered a local dispute; but
  as certain Resolutions were passed at a delegated Meeting held
  on the 3d of January, 1817, your Committee cannot refrain from
  noticing it:

  “‘_At a delegated Meeting of News Compositors, held at the Coach
  and Horses, Water-lane, Fleet Street, Jan. 3, 1817, the following
  Resolutions were passed unanimously:_

  “‘_Resolved_, I. That it is the opinion of this Meeting, that
  there are but three classes of Workmen on Morning Papers that
  can be acknowledged by the Profession, viz., _Full hands_ 2_l._
  8_s._ per week; _Supernumeraries_ at 1_l._ 3_s._ per week; and
  _Assistants_ at 11½_d._ per hour.

  “‘_Resolved_, II. That we consider the situation of _Finishers_
  on a Morning Paper, (where no person is employed to do the
  preceding part of the work,) as an innovation that would tend to
  disorganize the system hitherto acted upon.

  “‘_Resolved_, III. That under this consideration we recommend
  to our fellow-workmen to refuse any such situation should it be
  offered them.

  “‘_Resolved_ unanimously.--_That with respect to the ----
  (having no precedent to act upon) and there not being a regular
  Companionship, we recommend to the persons employed thereon to
  regulate the trifling difference between them and their employer
  as amicably as possible, keeping in view that the interests of
  the profession are not invaded thereby._’

  “This matter was amicably adjusted; but your Committee regret
  to state, that at the commencement of the following year, a
  dispute arose on another Journal, by a demand being made for
  eleven hours’ work (time and quantity)--or two measured galleys
  and a finish, sometimes extending to three hours. This mode was
  declared inadmissible by the trade; it was resisted; and you
  again triumphed by the sacrifice of situation only of those who
  refused their acquiescence.

  “Nothing appears worthy of notice after the above date till
  the month of May in the present year, and while your interests
  impose upon your Committee the necessity of laying before you
  the circumstances that then arose, they will trespass upon
  your patience only so long as the subject demands.--After the
  introduction of Nonpareil on the Journal mentioned in the year
  1816, the Trade were ignorant of the _men_ and their _modes of
  work_; you had no interest in the enquiry, for they never could
  be respected who had deserted your standard, nor pitied when
  labouring under difficulties they had brought upon themselves.
  From an accidental occurrence, not necessary here to repeat,
  a request was made, that a statement of the situation of that
  Journal might be laid before you. Policy dictated the propriety
  of receiving it; if those employed acted up to the spirit of your
  laws, you would have nothing to condemn; but if, on the contrary,
  they had violated your system, you would have the opportunity of
  declaring against it, and of preventing the evil example from
  spreading further. Custom, it is said, will in time become law;
  so would your silence have permitted the unprincipled to gratify
  themselves by the sacrifice of your rights and interests, and to
  undermine your whole system before you were aware of the danger.

  “By this statement it was discovered there were two _modes_ of
  work on that Journal, both in direct opposition to the rules and
  prices agreed upon in 1810. From the pressure of advertisements,
  two companionships were formed, one for the outer, and another
  for the inner form; those engaged on the former were offered, and
  accepted an Evening Paper price per galley for Nonpareil, Minion
  quantity; while those on the latter were employed according to
  the custom of the trade. It is unnecessary to comment on the
  introduction of _two companionships_ on a Daily Paper, much
  less to point out the absurdity of consenting to receive an
  Evening Paper price on a Morning Journal, upon the plea of its
  being performed by day-light; by the same parity of reasoning,
  you might demand a Morning Paper price for an Evening Journal,
  because, for a great part of the year, a portion of the work is
  done by candle-light. But an alteration on the inner-form system
  was shortly proposed, which was that rejected by yourselves in
  the year 1818--viz. _two galleys_ and _remaining_ till the paper
  went to press. This was refused by the employed, and seven out
  of twelve deserted this ‘flag of blackest hue.’

  “This circumstance, from the consequences that might probably
  follow, led to the appointment of a Committee to draw up, and
  circulate, for the information of the trade, a statement of the
  regular mode of working on Newspapers--‘to guide the ignorant,
  to guard the unwary.’ To assist them in their labours, and
  to maintain that harmony which should ever subsist between
  two branches in one profession, your Committee requested at a
  delegated Meeting of Book-men, the appointment of a gentleman
  from their body to assist them in the task assigned, which was
  most cheerfully met and cordially assented to.

  “After the appointment of your Committee, another circumstance
  arose which necessarily occupied a portion of their time. The
  Proprietor of an obscure Evening Journal, out of which a Sunday
  Paper is formed, made a demand on the employed to complete
  the Weekly Journal, not merely with a _reduction_ of wages,
  but absolutely for _nothing!_--as a kind of make-weight for
  the salary they received upon the other. This not being found
  in any article of your scale, was, of course, refused by the
  companionship, and the loss of situation followed: their places
  have been filled by some _distinguished_ characters, now out of
  the pale, but whose _memories_ will be cherished.

  “Your Committee will, by recapitulating the events related under
  each date, bring the various Regulations into one point of view,
  which, attached to your Scale of 1810, will, it is trusted,
  fully accomplish the purpose for which your Committee received
  their appointment. In 1786 a rise of 1-6th (or 4_s._ 6_d._)
  was obtained on Newspapers, but no Regulations were generally
  adopted; each Paper having its own mode, its internal management
  was regulated by existing circumstances; but in the year 1793,
  the nature of News-work, in a progress of seven years, was
  completely changed, and the price of necessaries increasing with
  the labour imposed, rendered it incumbent on your predecessors
  not only to solicit an advance of wages, but that the time
  and quantity should also be defined. This request was made by
  the Newsmen, and though sanctioned by the signatures of their
  brethren in the Book department, your Committee consider it as
  the first division of the Compositors into two branches of one
  profession. Their wishes were granted so far as related to a
  rise of ⅐th (or 4_s._ 6_d._) on Morning Papers; but nothing
  relating to the hours of work or time of commencing on Sundays
  was determined upon. It was acknowledged that the Supernumeraries
  should receive a proportionate advance, but your Committee cannot
  pass over the distinction then made between Morning and Evening
  Papers without expressing their regret at the circumstance. The
  latter only received a rise of 1-13th, or 2_s._ 6_d._ In the
  same year the Resolutions were passed against the employment of
  Apprentices on Papers. Some years prior to this date they were
  to be found on many of the Journals, and particularly on those
  called _Weekly_, arising from the connection of both classes
  with Book-houses; but, from the circumstances already mentioned
  (1793), when Daily Papers required separate establishments, and
  were conducted by non-professional men, your brethren took the
  opportunity of objecting to their re-admission on the latter
  class. The Resolutions of that day now stand as Laws; you
  struggled--you conquered; and your Committee can only add that
  five attempts against them failed of success. A rise was gained
  1801 of 4_s._ on Morning and 3_s._ on Evening Papers, making a
  still greater difference between the two classes of Journals.
  It was given and accepted without any reference to further
  regulations in the spirit of the proposition before quoted. The
  nature of the work and increase of labour on the Evening Journals
  from 1793 to 1800, required the adoption of the Resolution
  mentioned under the latter date:--‘That all Composition cease
  when the day’s publication goes to press--all work afterwards
  to be paid for as extra, or deducted from the first work of the
  next day’s publication.’ This regulation (with one exception)
  was generally accepted; the Printer had the choice of paying
  or deducting. A Scale of quantity, and a regulation for the
  twelve hours’ work, was also adopted. In the year 1809 it became
  necessary to solicit another rise. Twenty-four years had passed
  away; the system of News-work had ripened into perfection, and
  it merely required registering for the mutual convenience of
  the parties interested. With the request for an advance a Scale
  was introduced, which specifically defined the sum to be paid
  for labour. You accepted the offer of the Employers, which was
  a rise of 2_s._ on Morning, and 1_s._ on Evening Papers; but
  nothing was answered respecting the Scale, the sole object of
  your wishes. The following year you succeeded; and your Committee
  merely notice a fractional difference in the sums proposed and
  those now paid. The galley on a Morning Paper is stated at 3_s._
  9½_d._, now 3_s._ 10_d._; and the Evening Journals at 2_l._
  3_s._, instead 2_l._ 3_s._ 6_d._ per week. With this difference
  the Scale stands complete; and for its support, with a clear
  definition, have the labours of your Committee been wholly
  directed. ‘To guide the ignorant, to frustrate the machinations
  of the unprincipled, and, if possible, to form a closer bond
  of union among yourselves,’ has been their pleasing task. By
  a reference to the first Resolution of the Newsmen of May 19,
  1810, it will be observed, that they lament the want of a perfect
  collection of documents by which they might correctly trace the
  advances of wages from 1785 to 1800--indeed they assert that no
  records were extant. Your Committee congratulate themselves upon
  being more fortunate, and have extracted from, or inserted at
  length, every document relating to Regulations or Prices since
  1785, which they trust will not be considered uninteresting,
  and, handed down as records, may yet be useful. To prove the
  strength of your foundation, the Committee have embraced a period
  of fifty years, in which is included fifteen years prior to the
  date of the first document, and subsequently, through a space of
  thirty-five years, to the present time. In pursuing their duty,
  your Committee have not deviated from their path to obtrude upon
  your notice at this day all the misunderstandings which have
  arisen among the Journeymen, nor have they paused to revive the
  memory of local disputes with the employers; they have sought
  not ‘to rake the ashes of the dead’--they have endeavoured to
  avoid any reflection that might cause a blush in the living.
  The labours of your Committee will close with an Abstract of
  the Scale, and the Laws and necessary Regulations attached,
  which they trust will satisfactorily answer the purpose of their
  collection. You require nothing of the employers--they demand
  nothing from you; and shall it be said that your privileges
  must be forfeited by your own negligence, be scattered into
  air by the unprincipled, or sacrificed to the interest of a
  designing few?--Forbid it, spirit! while the recollection of the
  struggles of our predecessors lives amongst us. Your Committee
  conclude with soliciting your indulgence for any deficiency on
  their parts; but as your interest has been their sole object,
  your approbation their reward, they confidently trust the
  purity of their motives will be a sufficient apology for their
  unintentional errors.

  “Long Primer and Minion galleys, cast as nigh 5000 letters as

  “The galley on Morning Papers consists of 120 lines Long Primer,

  Papers 22 ems Long Primer wide; other widths in proportion; and
  a _finish_ of five hours. Another _mode_ is, one galley and a

  refreshment time) was the original agreement.

  “The _time_ of beginning to be the same uniformly as agreed upon
  by the Printer and Companionship--_i. e._ either a two, three,
  or four o’clock Paper--and at whatever hour the Journal goes
  to press one morning regulates the hour of commencing work for
  the next day’s publication, provided it should be over the hour
  originally agreed upon--if under, the time is in the Compositors’
  favour. The hour of commencing work on Sunday is regulated by the
  time of finishing on Saturday morning.

  “Ten hours’ Composition is the specified time for Evening

Provided always, that if any Newspaper shall be printed in _Great
Britain_ upon Paper stamped with a Stamp denoting the Allowance

in this Act or in any other Act or Acts relating to the printing or
publishing of Newspapers the Word ‘Newspaper’ is or may be used, it
shall be deemed and taken to mean and include any and every such
Paper as aforesaid; and in all Proceedings at Law or otherwise, and

  Ireland by the Authority of the Lord Lieutenant.

  “Daily Accounts or Bills of Goods imported and exported, or
  Warrants or Certificates for the Delivery of Goods, and the
  Weekly Bills of Mortality, and also Papers containing any Lists
  of Prices Current, or of the State of the Markets, or any
  Account of the Arrival, Sailing, or other Circumstances relating
  to Merchant Ships or Vessels, or any other Matter wholly of a
  Commercial Nature; provided such Bills, Lists, or Accounts do not
  contain any other Matter than what hath been usually comprised
  therein.”

The printing of daily newspapers in the metropolis is a distinct
branch from that of printing books and jobs, and is governed by
different rules and regulations, so as to require a separate account
of the process. The routine of business is uniform and regular,
without that variety which occurs in a book house: the qualifications
requisite for a compositor on a newspaper are, punctuality, quickness
in composing, and clean proofs, so that no delay may take place from
the deficiency of any one individual.

As the Times newspaper is one of the largest daily papers in Europe,
and as it is printed in a smaller type, and contains more matter
than any other, it consequently requires and employs more people to
prepare it for publication; and as it is generally acknowledged to be
one of the best conducted papers for the arrangement of its matter,
and the punctuality of its publication, I have selected it to give
as a specimen of the manner of printing a daily morning newspaper in
London.

The compositors employed to compose this great mass of intelligence
day by day, and every day throughout the year, Saturday excepted,
there being no publication on Sundays, are seventy-five, who are
divided into two classes; viz., the night or news hands, and the
advertisement hands. The first class consists of 39, who are divided
into full hands, 14; supernumeraries, 10; assistants, 15; to these
may be added 10 “outsiders,” who fill the frames of absentees in
cases of sickness, or from other causes: they are not considered as
belonging to the establishment, inasmuch as they hold no situation,
and are consequently dependent upon the workmen. The advertisement
department consists of 36 hands.

As it is desirable not to have to distribute letter after copy is
taken, the compositors usually put their letter in after all the
composing is completed, or take the opportunity when waiting for
copy, to be ready for the evening, or else they attend sooner in the
afternoon than the usual hour, for that purpose.

The full hands take copy at six o’clock in the evening, precisely,
and go on without regard to the old rule of first work and finish,
and the day’s work is considered to be completed at the expiration of
eleven hours, five o’clock in the morning; if engaged after that time
all hands are paid by the hour, the printer never availing himself
of the choice of beginning an hour later on account of the lateness
of the preceding morning. The full hands are expected to compose two
galleys each per night, and all over lines are paid for extra, even
though they are composed within the time prescribed by the rules laid
down for the guidance of compositors.

The supernumeraries are expected to compose one galley each per
night, and all over lines are paid for extra, the same as with the
full hands.

The full hands have each three pairs of cases--Nonpareil, Minion, and
Bourgeois; and as the most advantageous matter is generally set up in
the smaller type, they claim the benefit of it as an equivalent for
the labour of putting the forms to the machine.

The supernumeraries and assistants take copy at seven o’clock in the
evening, and continue to work till all is composed, and should there
be any standing still for want of copy, they are allowed at the rate
of a quarter of a galley per hour for all the time they may have lost
during the night. The assistants have no stated salary, but are paid
by the galley, and share the same advantages as the supernumeraries,
no distinction being made in the giving out of the copy.

The compositors in the news department have the privilege of
composing a considerable quantity of extra or “back” matter to enable
the printer to have at all times a resource in case of accident. This
extra copy is given out and divided into half galley shares, and
taken in rotation, thus preventing monopoly or favouritism.

As there is an immense quantity of letter in use, the division of
which for distribution would occasion loss of time, and frequent
disputes, the companionship pay a man to lay up the forms, mark the
letter off for each individual, and distribute the useless heads. He
is also answerable for the clearance of the boards.

Each compositor has a number attached to his frame, and when he
takes copy, his number is placed on the back of the copy, so that
each man’s matter is immediately identified, and in case of a foul
proof, or an out that will occasion much trouble, it is immediately
handed to him who composed it without further inquiry, which prevents
exposure and annoyance to the individual. The copy is also marked
with progressive numbers, which prevents confusion by enabling the
compositor to know with certainty, whom he follows in his composing,
and to empty his stick in the proper galley so as to join the
preceding matter.

As the matter is composed it is taken, a galley at a time, by the
printer, and made up into columns; a proof of the column is then
pulled upon the galley by one of the compositors, who all take it
in turn; it is then given to the reader; after being attentively
read and corrected, it is returned to the compositors to make the
corrections, who take it in turn, two and two; the column is divided
into four, the first compositor takes the first and third parts, and
the second takes the second and fourth parts, and he who is the last
in making his corrections, pulls a second proof, which is carefully
revised, and when the revise is corrected the matter is ready for
the paper. It thus goes on column after column, till the whole
paper is composed, when it often occurs that the arrival of foreign
intelligence increases the quantity considerably; matter of less
immediate interest is, in this instance, taken away, and kept as back
matter for a future day, to make room for the latest intelligence.

If the first compositor has six or more lines to compose of copy that
he has in hand, he must give it up, and begin to correct immediately;
but if he has less than six lines of copy in hand, he finishes it
before he commences correcting: this regulation is adopted to prevent
any interruption or delay in the progress of getting the paper out.

The full hands take it in turn to correct the revises, lock up the
forms, and take them to the machines to be worked off.

The advertisement department is not regulated after the same manner
as the news department, there being no distinction of grades, nor any
fixed salaries, nor is there any precise time of commencing work,
the uncertainty as to the time of advertisements being received at
the office rendering it an impossibility to appoint any regular hour
for beginning. The compositors are paid by the galley, not according
to the scale of prices fixed for morning papers, but more after the
scale of evening papers. The method adopted in this part of the
establishment in taking copy is the same as in other offices, the
first out of copy taking first, and so on, and as the compositors
come out of copy their numbers are placed on a slate, which prevents
disputes or confusion. The compositor marks his copy by putting his
initials at the back of it; so that if any gross error be committed,
and remain uncorrected, a wrong number in a reference, for instance,
it can immediately be ascertained who composed it, and either the
reader or the compositor is held responsible for the advertisement
duty, the proof deciding which is to pay the fine for negligence.

The salary of a full hand is 2_l._ 8_s._ per week, but the average
earnings are 3_l._ 12_s._ 6_d._; the salary of a supernumerary is
1_l._ 3_s._ per week, and the average earnings are 3_l._; it often
happens that much higher bills are written, but the above may be
taken as a fair average.

The whole establishment of the Times newspaper, including editors,
reporters, compositors, readers, engineer, overseers of the
machines, persons to lay on, and to take off, clerks, &c. consists
of one hundred and thirty-seven persons.

The following is the number of Stamps issued to four of the principal
London morning newspapers in 1838 and 1839, and also the amount of
advertisement duty paid by the said papers in each of the years 1837,
1838, and 1839, from official returns.

  _Newspaper Postage._--3 & 4 Vict. c. 96. “An Act for the
  Regulation of the Duties of Postage.”

  s. 1. “Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent
  Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords
  Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament
  assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all Letters and
  Newspapers and other printed Papers, which shall be posted in
  any Town or Place within the United Kingdom, or shall be brought
  from Parts beyond the Seas to any Port or Place within the
  United Kingdom, or shall be sent by the Post between the United
  Kingdom and Places beyond the Seas, or between any of the other
  Places herein-after mentioned, or shall pass through the United
  Kingdom, shall be subject to the several Regulations and Rates
  herein-after contained.”

  s. 12. “And be it enacted, That all Letters posted in any Town
  or Place within the United Kingdom shall, if written on stamped
  Paper or enclosed in stamped Covers, or having a Stamp or Stamps
  affixed thereto, and all printed Votes and Proceedings of the
  Imperial Parliament, and all Newspapers which shall be liable to
  Postage under this Act, shall, if posted in any Town or Place
  within the United Kingdom and enclosed in stamped Covers, or
  having a Stamp or Stamps affixed thereto, (the Stamp or Stamps
  in every such Case being affixed or appearing on the Outside,
  and of the Value or Amount herein-after expressed and specially
  provided under the Authority of this Act or of the said recited
  Act, [2 & 3 Vict. c. 52.] and if the Stamp shall not have been
  used before,) pass by the Post free of Postage, as herein-after
  mentioned.”

    “And on all such printed Votes and Proceedings of Parliament
    and Newspapers the Stamp or Stamps shall be equal in Value
    or Amount to the Rates of Postage to which such Votes or
    Proceedings or Newspapers would have been liable under this Act:

    “And that in all Cases in which the same shall be necessary,
    in order to place on any such Letters, printed Votes or
    Proceedings of Parliament, and Newspapers, the full Amount of
    Stamps hereby required as aforesaid, there shall be affixed
    thereto such a Number of Adhesive Stamps as alone or in
    Combination with the Stamp on such Letters or Packets, or
    on the Envelope or Cover thereof, will be equal in Amount to
    the Rate of Postage to which such Letters, printed Votes or
    Proceedings of Parliament, and Newspapers would be liable under
    this Act.

  s. 13. “And be it enacted, That in all Cases in which Letters
  posted in and addressed to Places within the United Kingdom shall
  be posted without any Stamp thereon, and without the Postage
  being pre-paid, there shall be charged on such Letters a Postage
  of Double the Amount to which such Letters would otherwise be
  liable under this Act; and in all Cases in which printed Votes
  or Proceedings of Parliament, or Newspapers liable to Postage
  under this Act, shall be posted without any Stamp thereon, there
  shall be charged on such Votes and Proceedings or Newspapers the
  Postage to which the same would be liable under this Act.”

  s. 16. “And be it enacted, That in all Cases in which any Votes
  or Proceedings of Parliament, Newspapers, addressed to Places
  within the United Kingdom, shall be posted, having thereon or
  affixed thereto any Stamp or Stamps the Value or Amount of which
  shall be less than the Rate of Postage to which such Votes or
  Proceedings or Newspapers would be liable under this Act, there
  shall be charged on such Votes or Proceedings or Newspapers a
  Postage equal to the Amount of the Difference between the Value
  of such Stamp or Stamps and the Postage to which such Votes or
  Proceedings or Newspapers would be liable as aforesaid.

  s. 17. “Provided always, and be it enacted, That it shall in all
  Cases be optional with the Parties sending any Letters, printed
  Votes or Proceedings of Parliament, or Newspapers, by the Post,
  to forward the same free of Postage by means of a proper Stamp
  or Stamps thereon or affixed thereto in manner herein-before
  provided, or to forward the same in like Manner as the same might
  otherwise have been forwarded under this Act; but nevertheless,
  in case any Letters, printed Votes or Proceedings of Parliament,
  or Newspapers, addressed to Places out of the United Kingdom,
  shall have thereon or affixed thereto any Stamp or Stamps being
  less in Amount or Value than the Rates of Postage to which such
  Letters, or such Votes or Proceedings, or Newspapers, would be
  liable under this Act, such Letters, printed Votes or Proceedings
  of Parliament, or Newspapers, if the Postage thereon be required
  by the Postmaster General under the Provisions of this Act to
  be paid when posted, shall not in any Case be forwarded by the
  Post, but shall, so far as may be practicable, be returned to
  the Senders thereof through the Dead Letter Office; and if
  the Postage on such Letters, printed Votes or Proceedings, or
  Newspapers, be not so required to be paid when posted, the same
  may be forwarded charged with such Postage as if no Stamp had
  been thereon or affixed thereto.”

  s. 32. “And be it enacted, That the Foreign Postage marked on
  any Letter or Newspaper, or other printed Paper brought into the
  United Kingdom, shall in all Courts of Justice and other Places
  be received as conclusive Evidence of the Amount of Foreign
  Postage payable in respect of such Letter, Newspaper, or other
  printed Paper, in addition to the _British_ Postage; and such
  Foreign Postage shall be recoverable within the United Kingdom
  and other Her Majesty’s Dominions as Postage due to Her Majesty.”

  s. 36. “And for encouraging Masters of Vessels, not being Post
  Office Packets, to undertake the Conveyance of Letters; be it
  enacted, That the Postmaster General may allow to Masters of
  Vessels, on Letters and Newspapers conveyed by them for or on
  behalf of the Post Office between Places within the United
  Kingdom, a Sum not exceeding Two Shillings and Sixpence for each
  and every Number of One hundred of such Letters and Newspapers,
  and for any less Number in the like Proportion, and may allow to
  the Masters of Vessels bound from the United Kingdom to the _East
  Indies_ a Sum not exceeding One Penny for each Letter and One
  Halfpenny for each Newspaper conveyed by them for or on behalf
  of the Post Office, and may allow to the Masters of all other
  Vessels a Sum not exceeding Two-pence for each Letter conveyed
  by them for or on behalf of the Post Office from the United
  Kingdom to Places beyond Sea, and may allow to the Masters of
  all Vessels not exceeding Two-pence for each Letter brought into
  the United Kingdom, which they shall deliver at the Post Office
  at the first Port at which they touch or arrive, or with which
  they communicate, (all which Gratuities may be paid at such Times
  and Places, and under all such Regulations and Restrictions, as
  the Postmaster General shall in his Discretion think fit); and
  every Master of a Vessel outward-bound shall receive on board
  his Vessel every Post Letter Bag tendered to him for Conveyance,
  and having received the same shall deliver it, on his Arrival at
  the Port or Place of his Destination, without Delay; and every
  Master of a Vessel inward-bound shall cause all Letters on board
  his Vessel (except those belonging to the Owners of the Vessel,
  or of the Goods on board, which do not exceed the prescribed
  Weights,) to be collected and enclosed in some Bag or other
  Envelope, and to be sealed with his Seal, and to be addressed
  to any of Her Majesty’s Deputy Postmasters, that they may be in
  readiness to send on shore by his own Boat, or by the Pilot Boat,
  or by any other safe or convenient Means, in order that the same
  may be delivered at the first regular Post Office which can be
  communicated with, and at the regular Port or Place where the
  Vessel shall report, shall sign a Declaration in the Presence of
  the Person authorized by the Postmaster General at such Port or
  Place, who shall also sign the same.”

  s. 42. “And be it enacted, That printed Newspapers may be
  sent free of Postage, or liable to Postage according to the
  Regulations and Rates herein-after set forth; (that is to say,)


    PRINTED BRITISH NEWSPAPERS,

    By the Post, from one Town or Place to another, within the
    United Kingdom (except by private Ships), free:

    By the Post of a Post Town, within the United Kingdom,
    addressed to a Person within the Limits of that Place or its
    Suburbs, One Penny each:

    Between Places within the United Kingdom by private Ships, One
    Penny each:

    Between the United Kingdom and Her Majesty’s Colonies, as
    follows:

    By Packet Boats to any of Her Majesty’s Colonies and
    Possessions beyond the Seas, (including the _East Indies_,
    by Packet Boats from the United Kingdom, _viâ_ _Syria_ or
    _Egypt_,) free:

    By private Ships, One Penny each.


    PRINTED COLONIAL NEWSPAPERS,

    Brought from the Colonies to the United Kingdom by Packet
    Boats, (including Newspapers from the _East Indies_, by Her
    Majesty’s _Mediterranean_ Packet Boats,) whether directed to
    a Place within the United Kingdom or to any of Her Majesty’s
    Colonies beyond the Seas, to be forwarded from the United
    Kingdom by Packet Boats, free:

    Brought from the Colonies to the United Kingdom by private
    Ships, addressed to Places within the United Kingdom, and
    delivered by the Master at the Post Office, One Penny each:

    Sent by Packet Boat through the United Kingdom to a Foreign
    State, (subject to the Consent of the Lords of the Treasury,)
    free:

    Newspapers between Foreign Countries and the United Kingdom, as
    follows:


    PRINTED BRITISH NEWSPAPERS,

    Sent from the United Kingdom to any Foreign Port, either by
    Packet Boats or private Ships, Two-pence each:

    When _British_ Newspapers are allowed to pass by Post in a
    Foreign Country free, then _British_ Newspapers addressed to
    such Foreign Country may be transmitted to any Foreign Port by
    Packet Boats, free:

    If transmitted by private Ships, One Penny each.


    PRINTED FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS,

    Brought into the United Kingdom by Packet Boats or Private
    Ships, Two-pence each:

    If _British_ Newspapers are allowed to pass by Post free in a
    Foreign Country, Newspapers printed in that Country brought by
    Packet Boat to the United Kingdom, free:

    If brought by private Vessels, One Penny each:

    Foreign Newspapers sent by Packet Boat through the United
    Kingdom to the Colonies (subject to the Consent of the
    Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury), free.

  s. 43. “And be it enacted, That although Newspapers may be sent
  by the Post, and thereupon subject to the Rate of Postage set
  forth in the above Table, it shall not be compulsory to send them
  by Post.

  s. 44. “And be it enacted, That no printed Paper, whether
  Newspaper or Votes and Proceedings in Parliament, or of the
  Colonial Legislature, shall be sent by the Post, either free
  or at the aforesaid Rates of Postage, unless the following
  Conditions shall be observed:

    First, It shall be sent without a Cover, or in a Cover open at
    the Sides.

    Second, There shall be no Word or Communication printed on the
    Paper after its Publication, or upon the Cover thereof, nor any
    Writing or Marks upon it or upon the Cover of it, except the
    Name and Address of the Person to whom sent.

    Third, There shall be no Paper or Thing enclosed in or with any
    such Paper.

    Fourth, The said printed Papers shall be put into the
    Post Office at such Hours in the Day, and under all such
    Regulations, as the Postmaster General may appoint, including
    therein the Payment of Postage on such as are going out of the
    United Kingdom when put into the Post Office, if the Postmaster
    General shall so require.

    Fifth, All Foreign Newspapers brought into the United Kingdom
    under this Act are to be printed in the Language of the
    Country from which they shall have been forwarded, unless the
    Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury shall in any Case
    direct that any Foreign Newspapers shall be exempted from the
    Restriction hereby imposed.

  s. 45. “And be it enacted, That the Postmaster General may
  examine any printed Paper or any Packet which shall be sent
  by the Post, without a Cover or in a Cover open at the Sides,
  in order to discover whether it is contrary in any respect
  to the Conditions hereby required to be observed, or to any
  Regulations which the Postmaster General, with the Consent of the
  Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, may from Time to Time
  make in respect of any Paper or Packet of such a Description, and
  also, in the Case of Newspapers, to ascertain in what Language
  the Newspapers brought into the United Kingdom from any Foreign
  Country shall be printed and published; and also in order to
  discover whether the Newspapers printed and published in the
  United Kingdom (excepting those printed in _Guernsey_, _Jersey_,
  _Alderney_, _Sark_, or _Man_, which, for the Purposes of this
  Act, are to be considered as Part of the United Kingdom) are duly
  stamped; and in case any one of the required Conditions has not
  been fulfilled, the whole of every such Paper or Packet shall
  be charged with Treble the Duty of Postage to which it would
  have been liable as a Letter, except as to Foreign Newspapers
  not printed in the Language of the Country from which they shall
  have been forwarded, which shall be charged with full Postage
  as Letters; and as to every such printed Paper going out of the
  United Kingdom, the Postmaster General may either detain the
  Paper or forward the same by the Post, charged with Treble the
  Duty of Postage to which it would have been liable as a Letter;
  and in case a Newspaper printed in the United Kingdom (except as
  aforesaid), and transmitted by the Post under this Act, shall
  appear not to have been duly stamped, the same shall be stopped
  and sent to the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes.

  s. 46. “And be it enacted, That in all Cases in which a Question
  shall arise whether a printed Paper is entitled to the Privilege
  of a Newspaper or other printed Paper hereby privileged, so far
  as respects the Transmission thereof by the Post under the Post
  Office Acts, the Question shall be referred to the Determination
  of the Postmaster General, whose Decision, with the Concurrence
  of the Lords of the Treasury, shall be final.

  s. 47. “And for providing for the Transmission of Newspapers
  between the United Kingdom and Foreign Countries free of Postage,
  when satisfactory Proof shall be laid before the Postmaster
  General that _British_ Newspapers addressed either to a Person
  or to a Place within a Foreign Country, and also that Newspapers
  addressed to a Person or a Place in the United Kingdom from such
  Foreign Country, are respectively allowed to pass by the Post
  within that Country free of Postage; be it enacted, That the
  Postmaster General may, with the Consent of the Commissioners of
  Her Majesty’s Treasury, transmit by the Post _British_ Newspapers
  addressed to a Person or to a Place in such Foreign Country from
  the United Kingdom, to any Port out of the United Kingdom, other
  than Her Majesty’s Colonies and Possessions, free from Postage;
  and he may, with the like Consent, receive from such Foreign
  Country Foreign Newspapers free from Postage, or he may, with
  the like Consent, charge for every Newspaper transmitted to or
  received from a Foreign Country a Rate of Postage which he may
  consider equivalent to the Rates of Postage payable in that
  Country on Newspapers either transmitted from or received in that
  Country, but in all Cases, whether the Newspaper be transmitted
  free or otherwise, subject to a Sea Postage of One Penny, payable
  on the Newspaper being put into the Post Office, for every
  Newspaper delivered at the Post Office to be conveyed by Vessels
  not being Post Office Packets, and also to a like Postage for
  every Newspaper received by Vessels not Post Office Packets
  addressed to a Person or to a Place within the United Kingdom.

  s. 48. “And whereas by reason of the Postage which may be charged
  on Newspapers in Foreign Countries, or from other Circumstances,
  it may be expedient again to impose the Rates of Two-pence on
  Newspapers; be it enacted, That the Postmaster General, with the
  Consent of the Lords of the Treasury, may again charge and demand
  the said respective Rates of Two-pence on Newspapers received
  from and sent to any Foreign Country.

  s. 49. “And be it enacted, That the Postmaster General, with the
  Consent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, may allow
  Colonial Newspapers to pass by the Post between Places within
  any of Her Majesty’s Colonies, or by Packet Boat or private Ship,
  from one Colony to another Colony, whether through the United
  Kingdom or not; and also allow Foreign Newspapers to pass through
  the United Kingdom either to Her Majesty’s Colonies or from one
  Foreign Country to another Foreign Country, by Packet Boat or
  private Ship; and also allow _British_ Newspapers to be sent to
  the Colonies through a Foreign Country, and Colonial Newspapers
  to be sent through a Foreign Country to the United Kingdom,
  or through the United Kingdom to a Foreign Country, free of
  Postage, or subject to such Rates of Postage and under all such
  Regulations and Restrictions as the Postmaster General, with such
  Consent as aforesaid, may think fit.

  s. 50. “And be it enacted, That every _British_ Newspaper sent
  by the Post to Places out of the United Kingdom shall in all
  Cases be put into a Post Office or Receiving Office in the United
  Kingdom within Seven Days next after the Day on which the same
  shall be published, the Day of Publication to be ascertained
  by the Date of such Paper; and in case a Paper shall be put
  into a Post Office after the Expiration of such Seven Days, the
  Postmaster General may either detain the Paper, or forward it by
  Post charged with full Postage as a Letter.

  s. 51. “And be it enacted, That in case any Person to whom a
  printed Newspaper brought into the United Kingdom shall be
  directed shall have removed from the Place to which it shall
  be directed, before the Delivery thereof at that Place, it may
  (provided it shall not have been opened) be re-directed and
  forwarded by Post to such Person at any other Place within the
  United Kingdom free of Charge for such extra Conveyance; but
  if the Newspaper shall have been opened, it shall be charged
  with the same Rate as if it were a Letter from the Place of
  Re-direction to the Place at which it shall be ultimately
  delivered.

  s. 52. “And be it enacted, That the Postmaster General may
  allow the Masters of Vessels, other than Packet Boats, a Sum
  not exceeding One Penny on every printed Newspaper, Foreign or
  Colonial, brought into the United Kingdom from a Port or Place
  out of the United Kingdom, and delivered by them at the Post
  Office of the Post Town at which they shall touch or arrive, and
  a Sum not exceeding One Penny on every printed Newspaper conveyed
  by them for or on behalf of the Post Office from the United
  Kingdom to any Port or Place out of the same, in respect of which
  no Gratuity is herein-before authorized to be allowed.”

  s. 57. “And be it enacted, That the Postmaster General may at
  any Time hereafter charge, for the Use of Her Majesty, on all
  Letters, Newspapers, and other printed Papers sent by the Post,
  on which the Postage shall not be pre-paid, and which shall not
  be duly and properly stamped, and also on all Letters sent by
  the Post without being duly and properly stamped, although the
  Postage thereon shall be wholly or in part pre-paid, such higher
  Rates of Postage than would otherwise by Law be payable on such
  Letters, Newspapers, or other printed Papers as the Commissioners

NICHOLS, JOHN. _See_ DONATIONS.


NICK.

A nick is a hollow cast crossways in the shanks of types, to make a
distinction readily between different sorts and sizes; and to enable
the compositor to perceive quickly the bottom of the letter as it
lies in the case, when composing; as nicks are always cast on that
side of the shank on which the bottom of the face of the letter is
placed.

A great deal of inconvenience frequently arises, owing to the
founders casting different founts of types with a similar nick in
each. Although this may, at the first sight, appear of little moment,
yet it is attended with much trouble: and works are frequently
disfigured by it, notwithstanding all the care of the compositor and
the reader, as will appear from the following statement.

A printer has cast a fount, we will suppose of Pica, in addition to
another he had in the house, and this new Pica is of a different face
from his old one; but not having given any particular directions,
the founder casts it with a nick precisely the same as the other.
The consequence is, when a compositor is distributing head lines,
lines of italic, small capitals, or small jobs--in the hurry of
business--through inadvertency--or carelessness--he frequently
distributes them into the wrong cases, when it is almost impossible
for another compositor who has occasion to use these cases next, to
detect the error till he sees the proof; unless he is in the habit
of reading his lines in the stick, which many are not. He has then
a great deal of trouble to change the letters; and, with all the
attention that the reader can bestow, a letter of the wrong fount
will frequently escape his eye, and disfigure the page.

Even in founts that are next in size to each other; for
instance,--Bourgeois and Long Primer, Long Primer and Small Pica,
Small Pica and Pica, and Pica and English, head lines, &c., are not
unfrequently distributed into wrong cases, where the nick is the
same; and always occasion loss of time in correcting the mistakes,
and sometimes pass undiscovered.

I would recommend, in furnishing a new office with types, that
every fount, commencing with the smallest, should have a different
nick from that of the next size: thus Brevier, supposing it to be
the smallest, might have three wide nicks, Bourgeois two closer
ones, and Long Primer one; Small Pica the same as Brevier, Pica
as Bourgeois, English as Long Primer; and here it might stop, for
there is difference enough in the sizes above English for the eye to
distinguish them readily, without varying the nick.

By going as far as three nicks, which is now generally done, a
sufficient variety may be obtained to distinguish one fount from
another without hesitation; but I would strongly advise that the
nicks should be deep, as it allows the compositor to see quickly how
the letters lie in the box, and enables him to pick them up with
greater facility, particularly by candlelight.

A single nick may be--low on the shank, in the middle, or nearer the
top; two nicks may be close together--at the bottom, in the middle,
or at the top, or they may be wide apart; three nicks may be--two at
bottom and one at top, two at top and one at bottom, or the three
close together, at the bottom, the middle, or the top, or wide
apart. Where there are a great number of founts, it would add to the
distinguishing mark, if consisting of more than one nick, that one
of them should be cast shallow: but where there is only one nick it
ought always to be cast deep.

NUMERALS.

The names of numerals are very different, not only in several parts
of Asia, but in both North and South America.

“Small stones were used amongst uncivilized nations: hence the words
_calculate_ and _calculation_ appear to have been derived from
_calculus_, the Latin for a pebble-stone. Alphabetic letters had also
a certain numerical value assigned them, and several Greek characters
were employed to express particular numbers.

“The combination of Greek numerical characters was not well known to
the Latins before the thirteenth century, although Greek numerical
characters were frequently used in France and Germany, in episcopal
letters, and continued to the eleventh century. But of all the
Greek ciphers the Episema ϐαῦ was most in use with the Latins: it
gradually assumed the form of _G_ with a tail, for so it appears in
a Latin inscription of the year _296_. It is found to have been used
in the fifth century in Latin MSS. It was reckoned for _6_, and this
value has been evinced by such a number of monumental proofs, that
there is no room to give it any other. Some of the learned, with
even Mabillon, have been mistaken in estimating it as _5_, but in a
posthumous work he acknowledges his error.

“Those authors were led into this error by the medals of the Emperor
Justinian having the episema for _5_; but it is a certain fact that
the coiners had been mistaken and confounded it with the tailed _U_,
for the episema was still in use in the fourth century, and among the
Latins was estimated as six, but under a form somewhat different.
Whenever it appears in other monuments of the western nations of
Europe of that very century, and the following, it is rarely used to
express any number except _5_.

“The Etruscans also used their letters for indicating numbers by
writing them from right to left, and the ancient Danes copied the
example in the application of their letters.

“The Romans, when they borrowed arts and sciences from the Greeks,
learned also their method of using alphabetical numeration. This
custom however was not very ancient among them. Before writing was
yet current with them they made use of nails for reckoning years,
and the method of driving those nails became in process of time a
ceremony of their religion. The first eight Roman numerals were
composed of the I and the V. The Roman ten was composed of the V
proper, and the V inverted (Ʌ), which characters served to reckon as
far as forty, but when writing became more general, I, V, X, L, C,
D, and M, were the only characters appropriated to the indication
of numbers. The above seven letters, in their most extensive
combination, produce six hundred and sixty-six thousand ranged thus,
DCLXVIM. Some however pretend that the Romans were strangers to any
higher number than 100,000. The want of ciphers obliged them to
double, treble, and multiply their numerical characters four-fold;
according as they had occasion to make them express units, tens,
hundreds, &c. &c. For the sake of brevity they had recourse to
another expedient; by drawing a small line over any of their numeral
characters they made them stand for as many thousands as they
contained units. Thus a small line over Ī made it 1000, and over X̄
expressed 10,000, &c.

“When the Romans wrote several units following, the first and last
were longer than the rest IIIIII: thus _vir_ after those six units,
signified _sex-vir_. D stood for 500, and the perpendicular line of
this letter was sometimes separated from the body thus (IƆ,) without
lessening its value. _M_, whether capital or uncial, expressed 1000.
In the uncial form it sometimes assumed that of one of those figures,
CIƆ Ɔ, CD, ∞, ო. The cumbent X was also used to signify a similar
number.

“As often as a figure of less value appears before a higher number,
it denotes that so much must be deducted from the greater number:
thus, I before V makes but four, I before X gives only nine, X
preceding C produces only 90, and even two XX before C reckons for no
more than 80. Such was the general practice with the ancient Romans
with respect to their numerical letters, which is still continued in
recording accounts in our Exchequer.

“In ancient MSS. 4 is written IIII and not IV, 9 thus VIIII, and not
IX, &c. Instead of V five units IIIII were sometimes used in the
eighth century. Half was expressed by an S at the end of the figures,
CIIS was put 102 and a half. This S sometimes appeared in the form of
our 5.

“In some old MSS. those numerical figures LXL are used to express
90. The Roman numeral letters were generally used both in England,
France, Italy, and Germany, from the earliest times to the middle of
the fifteenth century.

“The ancient people of Spain made use of the same Roman ciphers as
we do. The X with the top of the right hand stroke in form of a
semi-circle reckoned for 40; it merits the more particular notice as
it has misled many of the learned. The Roman ciphers however were
continued in use with the Spaniards until the fifteenth century. The
Germans used the Roman ciphers for a long time, nearly in the same
manner as the French.”

“The points after the Roman ciphers were exceedingly various, and
never rightly fixed. It is not known when the ancient custom was
first introduced of placing an O at top immediately after the Roman
characters, as A^o M^o L^o VI^o &c.”--_Astle._

If the lesser number is placed before the greater, the lesser is to
be deducted from the greater; thus IV signifies one less than five,
i. e. four; IX, nine; XC, ninety.

If the lesser number be placed after the greater, the lesser is to
be added to the greater; thus VI signifies one more than five, i. e.
six; XI, eleven; CX, one hundred and ten.

An horizontal stroke over a numeral denotes a thousand: thus V̄
signifies five thousand; L̄, fifty thousand: M̄, a thousand times a
thousand, or a million.

I, signifies _one_, because it is the smallest letter.

V, _five_, because it is sometimes used for U, the fifth vowel.

X, _ten_, because it represents two Vs.

L, _fifty_, from its resemblance to the lower half of C.

C, _a hundred_, centum.

IƆ or D, _five hundred_, the half of CIƆ.

M or CIƆ, _a thousand_, from mille. The latter figures joined at
the top ო formed the ancient M.--_Latin Vocabulary_, 18_mo._ _Lond.
Valpy_, 1823.


NUSTALEEK. _See_ PERSIAN.


NUT BOLTS.

Two bolts that pass through the head: they have square return heads,
which clasp the under side of the nut of the spindle to keep it firm
in its place.


NUT OF THE SPINDLE. It is also called the BOX, which _see_.




O.


OBELISK,

marked thus †, is used as a reference to notes in the margin, or at
the bottom of the page.

In printing it is technically called a _dagger_; and is the second
reference used, when more than one occurs in a page.


OCTAVO.

A sheet of paper folded into eight leaves or sixteen pages is termed
an octavo or 8vo.


ODD PAGE.

The first, third, fifth, seventh, and all uneven numbered pages, are
_Odd Pages_.--_M._


OFF.

A pressman usually says, I am off, meaning he has wrought off his
token, his heap, his form.--_M._ It is used also for part of the
whole number that is to be worked; as, when a ream, or two reams are
worked of a large number, he says, A ream’s off, Two reams off.


OFF CHEEK.

That cheek of the press which is on the opposite side to that at
which the pressmen stand to beat and pull; the catch of the bar is
fixed to the off cheek.


OFFCUT.

That part of a sheet which, when printed, cuts off, and when folded
is inserted in the middle of the other part, which together form a
regular and orderly succession of all the pages in the signature.


OIL.

The best oil for presses is neats foot oil, which does not candy nor
become glutinous, as almost all other oils do. On this account it is
used in the machinery employed in cotton manufactories, where it is
necessary to have as little friction as possible.


OLD ENGLISH. _See_ BLACK LETTER.


OPENING OF THE QUOINS.--_M._ _See_ UNLOCK THE FORM.


OPEN MATTER.

Full of breaks and whites.--_M._


OPEN THE FORM.

In laying-up a form to wash it, the compositor, after unlocking the
quoins, opens the matter with his fingers so as to suffer the water
to penetrate among the letters and wash away the lye and ink.--_M._


OPISTHOGRAPHIC.

The first productions of the press were printed on one side of
the paper only; as the art improved among the early printers they
impressed both sides: and those early productions, when they are
printed on both sides of the paper, are styled Opisthographic.

and Cambridge, the universities of Scotland, and the university of
Trinity College, Dublin, _see_ PAPER.


ORTHOGRAPHY.

The orthography of the English Language is attended with much
uncertainty and perplexity. But a considerable part of this
inconvenience may be remedied, by attending to the general laws of
formation; and, for this end, the reader is presented with a view of
such general maxims in spelling primitive and derivative words, as
have been almost universally received.

RULE I.--Monosyllables ending with _f_, _l_, or _s_, preceded by a
single vowel, double the final consonant; as staff, mill, pass, &c.
The only exceptions are, of, if, as, is, has, was, yes, his, this,
us, and thus.

RULE II.--Monosyllables ending with any consonant but _f_, _l_,
or _s_, and preceded by a single vowel, never double the final
consonant; excepting only, add, ebb, butt, egg, odd, err, inn, bunn,
purr, and buzz.

RULE III.--Words ending with _y_, preceded by a consonant, form
the plural of nouns, the persons of verbs, verbal nouns, past
participles, comparatives, and superlatives, by changing _y_ into
_i_; as, spy, spies; I carry, thou carriest; he carrieth or carries;
carrier, carried; happy, happier, happiest.

The present participle in _ing_, retains the _y_, that _i_ may not be
doubled; as, carry, carrying; bury, burying, &c.

But _y_, preceded by a vowel, in such instances as the above, is not
changed; as, boy, boys; I cloy, he cloys, cloyed, &c; except in lay,
pay, and say; from which are formed, laid, paid, and said; and their
compounds, unlaid, unpaid, unsaid, &c.

RULE IV.--Words ending with _y_, preceded by a consonant, upon
assuming an additional syllable beginning with a consonant, commonly
change _y_ into _i_; as, happy, happily, happiness. But when _y_ is
preceded by a vowel, it is very rarely changed in the additional
syllable; as, coy, coyly; boy, boyish, boyhood; annoy, annoyed,
annoyance; joy, joyless, joyful, &c.

RULE V.--Monosyllables, and words accented on the last syllable,
ending with a single consonant preceded by a single vowel, double
that consonant, when they take another syllable beginning with a
vowel: as, wit, witty; thin, thinnish; to abet, an abettor; to begin,
a beginner.

But if a diphthong precedes, or the accent is on the preceding
syllable, the consonant remains single: as, to toil, toiling; to
offer, an offering; maid, maiden, &c.

RULE VI.--Words ending with any double letter but _l_, and taking
_ness_, _less_, _ly_, or _ful_, after them, preserve the letter
double: as, harmlessness, carelessness, carelessly, stiffly,
successful, distressful, &c. But those words which end with double
_l_, and take _ness_, _less_, _ly_, or _ful_, after them, generally
omit one _l_, as, fulness, skilless, fully, skilful, &c.

RULE VII.--_Ness_, _less_, _ly_, and _ful_, added to words ending
with silent _e_, do not cut it off: as, paleness, guileless, closely,
peaceful; except in a few words: as, duly, truly, awful.

RULE VIII.--_Ment_, added to words ending with silent _e_, generally
preserves the _e_ from elision: as, abatement, chastisement,
incitement, &c. The words judgment, abridgment, acknowledgment, are
deviations from the rule.

Like other terminations it changes _y_ into _i_, when preceded by a
consonant: as, accompany, accompaniment; merry, merriment.

RULE IX.--_Able_ and _ible_, when incorporated into words ending
with silent _e_, almost always cut it off: as, blame, blamable;
cure, curable; sense, sensible, &c.; but if _c_ or _g_ soft comes
before _e_ in the original word, the _e_ is then preserved in words
compounded with _able_: as, change, changeable; peace, peaceable, &c.

RULE X.--When _ing_ or _ish_ is added to words ending with silent
_e_, the _e_ is almost universally omitted: as, place, placing;
lodge, lodging; slave, slavish; prude, prudish.

RULE XI.--Words taken into composition, often drop those letters
which were superfluous in their simples; as, handful, dunghil,
withal; also, chilblain, foretel.

The orthography of a great number of English words, is far from
being uniform, even amongst writers of distinction. Thus, _honour_
and _honor_, _inquire_ and _enquire_, _negotiate_ and _negociate_,
_control_ and _controul_, _expense_ and _expence_, _allege_ and
_alledge_, _surprise_ and _surprize_, _abridgment_ and _abridgement_,
and many other orthographical variations, are to be met with
in the best modern publications. Some authority for deciding
differences of this nature appears to be necessary; and where can
we find one of equal pretensions with Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary?
though a few of his decisions do not appear to be warranted by the
principles of etymology and analogy, the stable foundations of his
improvements.--“As the weight of truth and reason,” (says Nares
in his ‘Elements of Orthoepy,’) “is irresistible, Dr. Johnson’s
Dictionary has nearly fixed the external form of our language.
Indeed, so convenient is it to have one acknowledged standard to
recur to; so much preferable, in matters of this nature, is a
trifling degree of irregularity, to a continual change, and fruitless
pursuit of unattainable perfection; that it is earnestly to be hoped,
that no author will henceforth, on light grounds, be tempted to
innovate.”

The plural number of nouns is generally formed by adding _s_ to the
singular: as, dove, doves; face, faces; thought, thoughts. But when
the substantive singular ends in _x_, _ch_ soft, _sh_, _ss_, or _s_,
we add _es_ in the plural: as, box, boxes; church, churches; lash,
lashes; kiss, kisses; rebus, rebusses. If the singular ends in _ch_
hard, the plural is formed by adding _s_; as, monarch, monarchs;
distich, distichs.

Nouns which end in _o_, have sometimes _es_ added to the plural;
as, cargo, echo, hero, negro, manifesto, potato, volcano, wo: and
sometimes only _s_; as, folio, grotto, junto, nuncio, portico,
punctilio, tyro.

Nouns ending in _f_, or _fe_, are rendered plural by the change of
those terminations into _ves_: as, loaf, loaves; half, halves; wife,
wives; except grief, relief, reproof, and several others, which form
the plural by the addition of _s_. Those which end in _ff_, have the
regular plural: as, ruff, ruffs; except, staff, staves.

Nouns which have _y_ in the singular, with no other vowel in the same
syllable, change it into _ies_ in the plural: as, beauty, beauties;
fly, flies. But the _y_ is not changed, when there is another vowel
in the syllable: as, key, keys; delay, delays; attorney, attorneys.

Some nouns become plural by changing the _a_ of the singular into
_e_: as, man, men; woman, women; alderman, aldermen. The words, ox
and child, form oxen and children: brother, makes either brothers, or
brethren. Sometimes the diphthong _oo_ is changed into _ee_ in the
plural: as, foot, feet; goose, geese; tooth, teeth. Louse and mouse
make lice and mice. Penny makes pence, or pennies, when the coin is
meant; die, dice (for play); die, dies (for coining).

and Latin languages, are thus distinguished with respect to number.

The following observations relate to English and Scotch orthography,
temp. Hen. VIII.:--

_A_ is frequently used in Scottish orthography for _o_; as, _aith_
for _oath_, _ane_ for _one_, _twa_ for _two_, _hame_ for _home_,
_quha_ for _who_.

_Qu_ is in Scottish commonly substituted for _w_, as, _quha_ for
_who_, _quhair_ for _where_, _quhilk_ for _which_.

_U_ is in Scottish usually substituted for the English _oo_, as,
_guid_ or _gude_ for _good_, _stude_ for _stood_.

_V_ and _W_, at the commencement of words and syllables, are used
indiscriminately, and sometimes also at their termination, as,
_foryew_ for _foryeve_; _w_ is in Scottish also substituted for _u_
in the middle of syllables, as, _swt_ for _suit_.

_Y_ is in Scottish almost always used for _th_ (being corrupted from
the Anglo-Saxon þ), and its place supplied by _z_.

_Z_ is in Scottish constantly used for _y_, being corrupted from the
Anglo-Saxon ȝ.

_Verbs._--The following are some of the most commonly used irregular

substantive, as, Kinghis. It occurs sometimes, though rarely, after
a feminine substantive, as, “The Queen his affairs,” “The Queen is
favour;” but _her_ is more commonly used in that case, as, “Elizabeth
Holland her house.”


OUT.

A compositor usually says, I am out, meaning he has set out his page,
form, or copy.--_M._

When a compositor has omitted a word or words, a line, a sentence,
a paragraph, a page or a leaf of copy, which sometimes does happen,
each of these omissions is called an Out: thus we say, _An out of a
word--of two words--of a line_, &c.


OUTER FORM.

The form that has the first page of the sheet in it. It is usual to
work this form the last. _See_ LAY ON.


OUT OF COPY.

A compositor is said to be out of copy when he has composed all that
is in his possession, and there is no supply for him to go on with.
It is also termed standing still for copy.


OUT OF LETTER.

When a compositor has no letter in his cases, and none to distribute,
he is said to be out of letter.


OUT OF REGISTER.

Bad Register.--_M._ When the pages on both sides of a sheet do not
print exactly upon each other; or when line does not fall upon line,
where they are intended to do so; or folios are not justified in the
middle of the line; or when any thing on one side of a sheet does
not print exactly on the back of a similar thing on the opposite
side, which it is meant to do, it is said to be _Out of Register_, or
_Out_, or _It does not Register_, or _It is not in Register_.


OUT-PAGE.

In octavos, twelves, sixteens, every outside page in a sheet is
called an _Out-Page_; the rest are called _In-Pages_.--_M._


OUTSIDE QUIRES.

The two quires on the outside of every ream of paper delivered from
the maker; they have never more than twenty sheets in each, all of
which are either damaged or torn, more or less. These quires are also
called _Cassie Quires_, and _Cording Quires_. It is now uncommon to
send any outside quires to letter-press printers; the paper sent to
them for use being what is termed _Perfect_.


OUTSIDERS. _See_ NEWSPAPERS.


OVERFLOWING CASE. _See_ CASE RUNS OVER.


OVERLAYS.

Pieces of paper pasted on the tympan sheet, or on a sheet between the
tympans, to increase the pressure on particular parts of a form, to
make the impression more regular, or more perfect. _See_ ENGRAVINGS
ON WOOD. FINE PRESSWORK. MAKING READY.


OVERPLUS. _See_ WASTE.


OVERRUN.

If in a proof any matter is marked to be taken out, or to be
inserted, in a page, or pages, it will be necessary to take matter
from one page to another, to preserve them of a proper length, this
is termed overrunning: it may be a few words only in a paragraph,
and not extending beyond it; in this case it is termed overrunning a
paragraph.

The best method of overrunning matter is to take the lines into a
composing stick; the spacing and the justifying of the lines are
better preserved by this means, than by spacing out upon the stone in
the form, and feeling the ends of the lines with the fingers.


OVERSEER.

The manager or superintendent of a printing office. The duties of
an overseer vary according to the size of the establishment, and
the part that his principal takes in its management; but, generally
speaking, he has the sole conducting of the practical department,
receiving his general directions from the principal, and seeing that
they are carried into execution in a proper manner. It is requisite,
as a matter of course, that he should be intimately and practically
acquainted with the business in all its details. It is of importance
to the concern where he has the management, that he should blend
urbanity with firmness; and show judgment and impartiality in giving
out work, so that the business should proceed with regularity, and
with satisfaction to all parties.




P.


PAGE CORD.

Small twine with which the pages are tied round, to secure them
temporarily till they are imposed. Small net twine is the best, as
being stronger and more uniform in thickness than any other cord that
I have seen used for the purpose.


PAGE PAPER.

Stout paper cut up to the proper size, on which to place pages, till
they are wanted to be imposed.

The wrappers that come round bundles of paper are generally used,
for which the compositor applies to the warehouseman, who when he
has no wrappers, gives some of the stoutest waste paper that he has;
when it is not strong enough single the compositor uses it double.
Page papers are cut longer than a page of the work they are for, and
should be about an inch and a half broader than the width of the page
and turned up to the sides of it, so that when the compositor has
occasion to move his pages, he takes hold of both sides with one hand
including the sides of the page paper which supports the bottom of
the page.

Except the page papers be very stout, it would be running a risk to
place large quarto pages on them: in this case it will be better to
keep them on slices.


PALE COLOUR.

If there be not Blacking enough in the ink, or the form be beaten
with too lean balls, the work will be said to have a _Pale
Colour_.--M. The term is now applied only when there is a deficiency
of ink, so that the surface of the paper is not completely covered on
the impression of the types.


PAMPHLET.

Any work that does not exceed five sheets in octavo is termed a
pamphlet, and is paid something extra for at case, as a compensation
to the compositor for making up the letter and furniture without
having any return of either; the whole being generally put in chase.
_See_ SCALE OF PRICES.


PAMPHLETS.

  Act 60 Geo. 3. c. 9.--To subject certain Publications to the
  Duties of Stamps upon Newspapers, and to make other Regulations
  for restraining the Abuses arising from the Publication of
  Blasphemous and Seditious Libels.

  First recites, that Pamphlets and printed Papers containing
  Observations upon Public Events and Occurrences, tending to
  excite Hatred and Contempt of the Government and Constitution of
  these Realms as by Law established, and also vilifying our Holy
  Religion, have lately been published in great Numbers, and at
  very small Prices; and it is expedient that the same should be
  restrained, and enacts;

  s. 1. That all Pamphlets and Papers containing any Public News,
  Intelligence, or Occurrences, or any Remarks or Observations
  thereon, or upon any Matter in Church or State, printed in any
  Part of the United Kingdom for Sale, and published periodically,
  or in Parts or Numbers, at Intervals not exceeding Twenty-six
  Days between the Publication of any Two such Pamphlets or Papers,
  Parts or Numbers, where any of the said Pamphlets or Papers,
  Parts or Numbers respectively, shall not exceed Two Sheets,
  or shall be published for Sale for a less Sum than Sixpence,
  exclusive of the Duty by this Act imposed thereon, shall be
  deemed and taken to be Newspapers within the true Intent and
  Meaning of several other Acts of Parliament now in force relating

PAPER. The quality of paper is of great consequence in printing; but
it is too frequently overlooked by all parties.

Every pressman of common attention perceives a material difference
in the process of bringing off a sharp impression, according to the
quality of the paper that he uses. When he meets with a hard-sized
harsh paper, bleached with acid, it requires more than common care to
make his work look well--to make it good, it frequently defies his
utmost abilities--to preserve its first appearance is impossible, as
the acid in the paper decomposes the ink.

It is to be regretted, that there is hardly any paper made at the
present time but what is more or less bleached with acid, to the
deterioration of its quality. The study of the paper maker is to
produce stout and viewly paper at a low price; and this he does by
using inferior rags bleached by acid; by adding a great proportion
of gypsum, in some instances one seventh of its weight, in others
one eighth; and frequently of whiting made from lime: he will thus
produce a paper weighing sixteen or seventeen pounds a ream, that
will feel as stout and look as viewly as an honest-made paper from
good rags that will weigh about twenty-two pounds. To the publishers
of cheap books, and of ephemeral productions, the price of paper is
an important object; but no work of value ought to be printed on such
an article, as it cannot be durable, nor will it bear much use,
becoming tender with age, and breaking by turning over the leaves.

The origin of this viewly, inferior, perishable paper, was in
consequence of the alteration of the duty on paper paid by the maker,
from size to weight.

These evils are, however, in a fair way of being rectified. The paper
makers of the present day are exerting their abilities to manufacture
an article which, with all the beauty and fineness that are held so
requisite, should be free from the evils which have of late years
accompanied these qualities. Great improvements have already resulted
from their endeavours; and one of the foremost in this praiseworthy
competition is the house of Messrs. John Dickinson and Co., who have
succeeded in manufacturing a paper of great fineness and beauty, and
free from the imperfections of which we have had to complain.

The Rev. William Beloe, in his Anecdotes of Literature, &c. speaking
of the paper on which books in the infancy of printing were executed,
observes,--

“This presents a very fertile subject of discussion. Here, as in ink,
two very distinct kinds occur, writing-paper and printing-paper, or
rather did then; for the invention of paper made from rags did not
precede that of printing more than half a century; and perhaps the
first experiments were made on the paper in common use. But here it
is worthy of remark, that in this particular fabrick of paper, the
Italians far excelled the Germans; for it will appear that the paper
used by Sweynheym and Pannartz in the Lactantius, printed at Subiaco,
is greatly superior to that of the first printers at Mentz. But it
is also a matter of surprise, in how very short a period, and to
what a degree of excellence, the manufacture of paper was improved;
never, perhaps, for the purposes of printing, to be excelled. Many
of the EDITIONES PRINCIPES exhibit specimens of beauty and splendour
never surpassed in all the productions of modern times. The earliest
specimens of printing, however, were upon vellum; for which there
were two reasons. The first was, that it was the object of the
first printers to make their books as much as possible to resemble
manuscripts; and the anecdote of Fust, and his disposing of his
Bibles at Paris, which were considered as manuscripts, has before
been related. The next motive of preferring vellum was, that the
books were more durable; but from this circumstance, it sometimes
happens that early books on paper are more difficult of attainment
than on vellum. Yet the Mazarine Bible, which is now usually allowed
to be the edition brought to Paris by Fust, is usually on paper. The
Durandus, however, is never found but on vellum. It is observable,
that the first printed books are distinguished by very ample
margins. This, though considered by collectors in modern times as a
distinguishing feature of beauty and excellence, was, in the infancy
of the art, merely intended for the convenience of writing notes and
making observations. Another very copious subject of animadversion is
involved in the marks of the paper used in the infancy of printing.
As the first printers often omitted to put their names to their
works, many have supposed that a careful examination of the paper
and paper-marks would ascertain to what printer such books might be
ascribed. But this is very delusive.”

The following are the regular sizes of paper, of all descriptions, as
they were fixed when the duty was paid to government according to the
size. After the alteration in the mode of laying the duty, and it was
imposed upon the weight and not upon the size, the makers began to
vary the dimensions, so that in fact there is no regularity in them:
yet the list will be useful in ascertaining those variations--in
knowing what the size of each sort ought to be--and the comparative
dimensions when folded into quarto, octavo, duodecimo, &c. for
printing; and I have given all the list, although only a small part
of it contains what are termed printing papers; yet the whole may be
useful as a matter of reference.

The subjoined table shows the dimensions of the leaves of each sort
of paper when folded into the various sizes. It will be serviceable
to the printer, by enabling him to ascertain easily what kind of
paper will cut up to the most advantage for jobs, labels, &c.; and
it will be equally serviceable to the bookseller, by enabling him
to ascertain what sized paper will be the most economical to print
a work on, when the size of the page is fixed, as he will perceive,
on referring to it, that a foolscap octavo is 6¾ inches high, and 4⅛
inches broad; and that a royal eighteens is 6⅝ inches high, and 4¼
inches broad; that a post octavo is 7⅝ inches high, and 4⅞ inches
broad; and a medium duodecimo is 7⅝ inches high, and 4½ inches
broad;--so as to give him the option of saving both in presswork and
the price of paper, without the trouble of having to fold various
specimens of paper. It will also serve to ascertain the paper on
which any book or job is printed.

I have not carried the calculation to a smaller fraction than
the eighth of an inch, as that is near enough for all practical
purposes, considering the variations in the size of paper; and when
the division came to less, I adopted the next number; so that in
some cases the parts of a sheet will be a little larger than the
dimensions.

_D._ signifies drawing paper; _P._ printing paper; and _W._ writing
paper.

  10 Geo. 2. c. 27. s. 4. _Drawbacks._--“And whereas the Drawbacks

  aforesaid, That from and after the twenty-fourth Day of _June_
  One thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven, there shall not be
  allowed or made on the Re-exportation of any foreign Paper any
  Drawback or Repayment of any of the Customs or Duties charged and

  Acts of Parliament; any Law, Custom, or Usage to the contrary
  thereof in anywise notwithstanding.”

  “Whereas the Laws for collecting and securing the Duties of

  enacted, by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with
  the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,

    _Allowances._--“For all such Glazed or other Press Papers, made

    Halfpenny:

  _Stamps._--s. 8. “And be it enacted, That the Commissioners of
  Excise shall and they are hereby required to provide or cause
  to be provided proper Stamps, with such Marks and Devices
  thereon as they shall see fit for marking or stamping all Paper,
  Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, and Scale-board, to denote
  the Duty being charged thereon, when made and tied up in the
  Manner herein-after directed, and shall cause such Stamps to be
  delivered to the Officers of Excise for that Purpose; and it
  shall be lawful for the said Commissioners of Excise to cause the
  said Stamps, or the Marks and Devices thereon, to be altered or
  varied as they shall from Time to Time see fit.

  any Maker of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or
  Scale-board shall carry on his Manufacture, a sufficient Number
  of Labels, of such Form and Construction and with such Devices
  thereon as the said Commissioners shall deem fit and proper,
  to be used in the tying up of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, and Scale-board, as herein-after by this Act
  directed; and every such Paper Maker shall, on his Request in
  Writing given to the proper Officer of Excise, specifying therein
  the Number of Labels which such Maker may require, be within Four
  Days after the Receipt of such Request supplied by such Officer
  with the Number of Labels required, each Label being signed by
  the Supervisor of the District for the Time being, and marked by
  such Supervisor with the Number or Letter or Number and Letter
  by which the Mill of such Paper Maker is then distinguished in
  the Books of the Excise; and every such Paper Maker, or his chief
  Workman or Servant, shall, at the Time of the Delivery of such
  Labels, give on the Back of the Request Note requiring the same a
  Receipt in Writing, signed by him, for the said Number of Labels
  delivered to him by the Officer of Excise; and all such Labels
  shall at all Times, when demanded by any Supervisor of Excise, or
  other Officer of Excise of equal or superior Rank, be delivered
  to the Supervisor or other such Officer demanding the same; and
  every Paper Maker who shall, by himself or his chief Workman or
  Servant, refuse to give such Receipt as aforesaid for the Labels
  delivered to him, or who shall destroy, cancel, or obliterate any
  such Label, or shall sell or dispose of or use any such Label
  for any other Purpose than in tying up Paper, Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board as herein-after directed,
  or shall suffer the same to be done, or who shall refuse to
  produce or deliver to any Supervisor or other such Officer as
  aforesaid demanding the same any such Label or Labels, or shall
  not satisfactorily account for any Label which shall be at any
  Time missing, shall forfeit for every Label so delivered to him,
  and for which a Receipt shall not be given, or which shall be
  cancelled, obliterated, or destroyed, sold or disposed of, or
  improperly used or not produced or accounted for, Ten Pounds.

  s. 10. “And be it enacted, That every Paper Maker shall cause all
  Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, and Scale-board
  made by him to be made up into Reams or Half Reams or Parcels,
  and shall also cause every such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel to
  be enclosed in a Wrapper or Wrappers, on or to which Wrappers,
  or One of them if Two are made use of, One of the Labels
  herein-before directed to be provided and delivered to Paper
  Makers shall have been previously firmly and permanently fixed
  and united with Paste or Glue or other binding Cement, and
  pressed and dried thereon, and which Label, when such Ream,
  Half Ream, or Parcel is tied up, shall be on the Top thereof,
  or on such other Part of the Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel as the
  Commissioners of Excise shall direct; and every such Ream, Half
  Ream, or Parcel shall, as soon as made up and enclosed in the
  Wrapper or Wrappers, be immediately firmly and securely tied
  up with strong Thread or String; and when and so soon as any
  Ream or Half Ream or Parcel of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, or Scale-board, shall be tied up in manner
  aforesaid, the Maker thereof shall write or print, in large and
  legible Letters, with durable Ink, on the Label affixed on the
  Top thereof as aforesaid, the Description or Denomination and
  the Contents of such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel, whether Paper,
  Glazed-paper, Sheathing-paper, or Button-paper, or Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board; and every Paper Maker
  who shall neglect or refuse to enclose and tie up any Ream, Half
  Ream, or Parcel of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board,
  or Scale-board, in a Wrapper or Wrappers, to which, or to One
  of which Wrappers, One of such Labels shall have been affixed
  according to the Directions herein-before given, or immediately
  to write or print in manner aforesaid the Particulars required
  to be written or printed on the Label affixed on each Ream,
  Half Ream, or Parcel, shall forfeit Ten Pounds for every Ream,
  Half Ream, or Parcel not enclosed and tied up according to the
  Directions aforesaid, or not having written or printed in manner
  aforesaid on the Label affixed to the Wrapper the Particulars
  herein-before required to be written or printed thereon, and
  every such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel shall also be forfeited.

  s. 11. “And be it enacted, That a Ream of Paper, other than
  Glazed-paper, Sheathing or Button Paper, shall consist of Twenty
  Quires, each Quire containing Twenty-four Sheets, or Forty Half
  Quires, each Half Quire being Twelve Sheets; and a Half Ream of
  Paper shall consist of Ten Quires, or Twenty Half Quires, save
  and except the Ream or Half Ream of Paper for printing, which
  may consist of any Number of Sheets not exceeding Five hundred
  and sixteen Sheets the Ream, or Two hundred and fifty-eight
  Sheets the Half Ream, and save and except the outside Quires of
  any Ream of Paper, which may consist of any Number of Sheets
  not less than Twenty nor more than Twenty-four; and a Parcel
  of Glazed-paper, Sheathing-paper, Button-paper, Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board shall consist of even
  Dozens of Sheets of one and the same Denomination or Description,
  and of equal Dimensions, and not less than Twenty-four nor more
  than Seventy-two such Sheets in each Parcel; and all Paper,
  Glazed-paper, Sheathing-paper, Button-paper, Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board which shall be made up
  or tied up in any other Quantities than as aforesaid shall be
  forfeited.

  s. 12. “Provided always, and be it enacted, That if from the Size
  of the Sheets, or from any other Cause, it shall be necessary
  for any Paper Maker to make and tie up any Paper, other than
  Glazed-paper, Sheathing-paper, or Button-paper, in any less
  Quantities than a Ream or Half Ream, it shall be lawful for such
  Paper Maker to make and tie up such Paper in Parcels containing
  a less Number of Sheets than a Ream or Half Ream, provided that
  he write and specify on the Label attached to the Wrapper of such
  Parcel the true Number of Sheets of Paper contained therein:
  Provided always, that no Paper shall be made up into any such
  Parcel or into any Half Ream weighing less than Twenty Pounds.

  s. 13. “And be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for any Paper
  Maker, before tying up any Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, or Scale-board into Reams, Half Reams, or Parcels,
  to cut the Edges thereof, and also for any Paper Maker to make
  his Paper into Quires without folding the same, such Quires, when
  made up into Reams or Half Reams, being separated by a Slip of
  coloured Paper.

  s. 14. “And be it enacted, That every Paper Maker shall,
  at the Time when any Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel of Paper,
  Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board is tied
  up as herein-before directed, or at or before the Time when the
  same is or shall be produced to be weighed and charged with
  Duty by the Officer of Excise, write on the Label on every such
  Ream, Half Ream, and Parcel respectively the Weight thereof in
  large and legible Letters, and in Words at Length, joining to
  the Words expressing the Weight the Letters “lbs.,” or the Word
  “Pounds,” on pain of forfeiting for every Omission or Neglect the
  Sum of Ten Pounds, and the Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel of Paper,
  Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board.”

  s. 17. “And whereas it is expedient to make Provision for Paper
  being tied up and charged with Duty, and sent out in single
  Sheets on the Rollers on which the same may be rolled or received
  from the Machine, without cutting or making the same up into
  Reams; be it enacted, That every Paper Maker who shall intend so
  to send out any Paper shall, before using any Roller or Rollers,
  mark the true Weight of every such Roller in legible Letters
  or Numbers on the End thereof, and shall continue the same so
  marked, and shall upon each Occasion of using the same produce
  every such Roller so marked to the Officer of Excise surveying
  his Mill, who shall ascertain that such Weight is correctly
  marked, and shall sign his Name or Initials under such Mark;
  and every such Paper Maker shall cause all such Paper, as soon
  as received from the Machine, to be tied up, as herein-before
  directed, in a Wrapper or Wrappers, on or to which, or One of
  them, a Label has been firmly and permanently fixed and united,
  but in such Manner that the End of the Roller having the Weight
  thereof marked thereon shall be open and visible to the Officer
  of Excise, and shall write upon such Label all the Particulars
  herein-before required to be written by the Paper Maker on the
  Label; and it shall be lawful for the Officer of Excise weighing
  and charging with Duty any such Paper, and he is hereby empowered
  and required, to deduct and allow from the Weight thereof the
  even Pounds (Fractions of a Pound being disregarded) marked on
  the End of the Roller on which each Parcel of such Paper shall
  be rolled, and the Remainder shall be taken as the Weight of the
  Paper on which the Duty shall be charged: Provided always, that
  no such Deduction or Allowance shall be made in the Case of any
  Paper which shall be produced to the Officer of Excise in any
  Parcel not having the End of the Roller open and visible to the
  Officer of Excise, or rolled on any Roller which shall not have
  the true Weight legibly and clearly marked on the End thereof as
  herein-before directed.”

  s. 24. “And be enacted, That every Paper Maker who, after any
  Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, or Scale-board shall have been so made and tied up,
  and the Particulars herein-before required written or printed
  on the Label on the Wrapper thereof, shall, either before or
  after such Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or
  Scale-board shall have been weighed and charged with Duty by the
  Officer of Excise, make any false Entry on the Label affixed on
  the Cover or Wrapper of any Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, or Scale-board, or deface, obliterate, extract, or
  fraudulently alter any of the Particulars written or printed
  by such Paper Maker, or by the Officer of Excise, or shall
  take off, remove, or detach, or cause or permit or suffer to
  be taken off or removed or detached, any such Label from the
  Cover or Wrapper of any Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel of Paper,
  Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board, made and
  tied up under the Directions of this Act, or who shall use any
  Label, or any Wrapper to which any Label is affixed, to cover or
  tie up any other Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or
  Scale-board than that contained in such Wrapper, with such Label
  when first tied up, or who shall, after any Paper, Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board shall have been weighed
  and charged with Duty, open any Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel,
  and remove any Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board,
  or Scale-board out of the Wrapper or Wrappers in which the
  same shall have been so weighed and charged, or who shall add
  any other Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or
  Scale-board thereto, or shall in any respect make any Alteration
  in any such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel, shall for every such
  Label, Wrapper, Ream, Half Ream, and Parcel respectively in
  respect of which any such Offence shall be committed forfeit
  Twenty Pounds, and every such Label and Wrapper, Ream, Half
  Ream, and Parcel, with the Paper, Button-board, Mill-board,
  Paste-board, or Scale-board contained therein, shall also be
  forfeited.”

  s. 26. “And be it enacted, That every Paper Maker who shall sell,
  send out, deliver, or remove any Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel of
  Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board
  without the same being tied up in a Wrapper or Wrappers on which,
  or on the uppermost of which, One of such Labels as is by this
  Act required shall have been permanently affixed, or not having
  written or printed on the Label affixed to the Wrapper all the
  Particulars by this Act required to be written and printed on
  such Label, shall, in respect of every such Ream, Half Ream, or
  Parcel so sold, sent out, delivered, or removed, forfeit Twenty
  Pounds, and every such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel which shall be
  found in the Possession of any Person not having such Label, with
  the Particulars aforesaid thereon, shall also be forfeited.

  s. 27. “And be it enacted, That if any Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel
  of Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board
  shall at any Time, on being weighed by any Officer of Excise,
  either at the Mill where manufactured or elsewhere, be found
  to weigh under or over the Weight marked, written, or printed
  on such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel by the Maker thereof as
  herein-before required, in the Proportion of Five _per Centum_
  if the Weight marked on such Ream, Half Ream, or Parcel exceed
  Twenty Pounds, or Ten _per Centum_ if such Weight be Twenty
  Pounds or less, the same shall be forfeited.”

  s. 37. “And be it enacted, That no Stationer or Printer or Paper
  Stainer, or Maker of Paste-board not a Maker of Paper, shall
  receive into his Custody or Possession, nor shall any other
  Person remove or receive from any Mill, any Paper, Button-board,
  Mill-board, Paste-board, or Scale-board which shall not be
  an entire Ream or Half Ream or Parcel, enclosed in a Wrapper
  or Wrappers having a Label thereon, with such Particulars as
  are herein-before required written thereon, together with the
  Impressions of the Officer’s Stamp denoting the Charge of
  Duty, on pain of forfeiting One hundred Pounds; and all Paper,
  Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board, and Scale-board so
  received, and all Paper, Button-board, Mill-board, Paste-board,
  and Scale-board which shall be found in the Custody or Possession
  of any Stationer or Printer or Paper Stainer, or Maker of
  Paste-board not a Maker of Paper, (not being broken Reams, or

     “The same Duties from the East Indies.

     “No Drawback.”


PAPER BENCH.--_M._ _See_ BANK, also HORSE.


PAPER BOARD.

Boards made of deal plank, on which to place paper when wetted for
printing. They have two slips of deal nailed to the bottom of each
to strengthen them, and to prevent the joining from giving way;
these slips are broader and not so thick as those inserted in letter
boards. The general sizes are, demy boards, twenty-six inches by
twenty-two; royal, thirty inches by twenty-six.


PAPER THE CASE.

Lining the bottom of the boxes in the cases with paper.--_M._ This
was formerly done by the compositor; it is now done by the printer’s
joiner before the bottom is nailed on.


PAPER UP LETTER.

To wrap the pages up in paper after a work is finished.--_M._

In all book houses, there are bulks appropriated for the letter that
is cleared away; so that when it is dry it may be papered up. In
small houses this is generally done by the overseer; but in houses
with large establishments, there is a person appointed to take care
of the letter, furniture, chases, &c. which he keeps locked up, and
delivers out as wanted: he also papers up the letter; that is, he
wraps up each piece in the waste of some work, which he procures
from the warehouse, and on which he writes the name of the type;
it also tends to save trouble if he add whether it be open matter,
Italic, or figures, as the case may be, as it prevents the necessity
of opening the pieces out, when particular kinds only are wanted for
distribution.


PAPER STOOL.

A stool with a large square top, on which to lay printed paper after
it has been worked off, while the warehouseman is hanging it up to
dry. There is a notch cut in the top to admit the fingers, for the
greater convenience of moving it about.


PAPER WINDOWS. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.


PARAGON.

The name of a type, one size larger than Great Primer, and one
smaller than Double Pica. Moxon does not enumerate this size in his
list. It is equal to two Long Primers. _See_ TYPES.


PARAGRAPH.

A paragraph ¶ denotes the beginning of a new subject, or a sentence
not connected with the foregoing. This character is chiefly used in
the Old and in the New Testament.--_Murray._

It is also used as a reference to notes, in printing.


PARAGRAPHS.

As a compositor is sometimes allowed to divide a paragraph in his
manuscript copy, for the convenience of workmanship, the following
observations on the subject, by Lindley Murray, may be serviceable:--

“Different subjects, unless they are very short, or very numerous in
small compass, should be separated into paragraphs.

“When one subject is continued to a considerable length, the larger
divisions of it should be put into paragraphs. And it will have a
good effect to form the breaks, when it can properly be done, at
sentiments of the most weight, or that call for peculiar attention.

“The facts, premises, and conclusions, of a subject, sometimes
naturally point out the separations into paragraphs: and each of
these, when of great length, will again require subdivisions at their
most distinctive parts.

“In cases which require a connected subject to be formed into several
paragraphs, a suitable turn of expression, exhibiting the connexion
of the broken parts, will give beauty and force to the division.”


PARALLEL.

Marked thus ‖, is used as a reference to notes in the margin, or at
the bottom of the page.


PARCHMENT.

Parchment is used for covering the tympans, both inner and outer:
care should be used in selecting it, that the skins are free from any
imperfections or cuts, and that they are of an uniform thickness,
as nearly as possible. The parchment for the inner tympan may be a
little thinner than that for the outer. Dealers in printing materials
generally keep a stock of old deeds, leases, &c. which are cheaper
than new parchment, and are frequently used for common work.

PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.

  3 Vict. c. 9. “An Act to give summary Protection to Persons
  employed in the Publication of Parliamentary Papers.

  “Whereas it is essential to the due and effectual Exercise
  and Discharge of the Functions and Duties of Parliament, and
  to the Promotion of wise Legislation, that no Obstructions or
  Impediments should exist to the Publication of such of the
  Reports, Papers, Votes, or Proceedings of either House of
  Parliament as such House of Parliament may deem fit or necessary
  to be published: And whereas Obstructions or Impediments to
  such Publication have arisen, and hereafter may arise, by means
  of Civil or Criminal Proceedings being taken against Persons
  employed by or acting under the Authority of the Houses of
  Parliament, or One of them, in the Publication of such Reports,
  Papers, Votes, or Proceedings; by reason and for Remedy whereof
  it is expedient that more speedy Protection should be afforded
  to all Persons acting under the Authority aforesaid, and that
  all such Civil or Criminal Proceedings should be summarily put
  an end to and determined in manner herein-after mentioned: Be
  it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty,
  by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and
  Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and
  by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful for
  any Person or Persons who now is or are, or hereafter shall be,
  a Defendant or Defendants in any Civil or Criminal Proceeding
  commenced or prosecuted in any Manner soever, for or on account
  or in respect of the Publication of any such Report, Paper,
  Votes, or Proceedings by such Person or Persons, or by his,
  her, or their Servant or Servants, by or under the Authority
  of either House of Parliament, to bring before the Court in
  which such Proceeding shall have been or shall be so commenced
  or prosecuted, or before any Judge of the same (if One of the
  Superior Courts at _Westminster_), first giving Twenty-four Hours
  Notice of his Intention so to do to the Prosecutor or Plaintiff
  in such Proceeding, a Certificate under the Hand of the Lord
  High Chancellor of _Great Britain_, or the Lord Keeper of the
  Great Seal, or of the Speaker of the House of Lords, for the Time
  being, or of the Clerk of the Parliaments, or of the Speaker of
  the House of Commons, or of the Clerk of the same House, stating
  that the Report, Paper, Votes, or Proceedings, as the Case may
  be, in respect whereof such Civil or Criminal Proceeding shall
  have been commenced or prosecuted, was published by such Person
  or Persons, or by his, her, or their Servant or Servants, by
  Order or under the Authority of the House of Lords or of the
  House of Commons, as the Case may be, together with an Affidavit
  verifying such Certificate; and such Court or Judge shall
  thereupon immediately stay such Civil or Criminal Proceeding,
  and the same, and every Writ or Process issued therein, shall
  be and shall be deemed and taken to be finally put an end to,
  determined, and superseded by virtue of this Act.

  s. 2. “And be it enacted, That in case of any Civil or Criminal
  Proceeding hereafter to be commenced or prosecuted for or on
  account or in respect of the Publication of any Copy of such
  Report, Paper, Votes, or Proceedings, it shall be lawful for
  the Defendant or Defendants at any Stage of the Proceedings to
  lay before the Court or Judge such Report, Paper, Votes, or
  Proceedings, and such Copy, with an Affidavit verifying such
  Report, Paper, Votes, or Proceedings, and the Correctness of such
  Copy, and the Court or Judge shall immediately stay such Civil

  Extract or Abstract was published _bonâ fide_ and without Malice;
  and if such shall be the Opinion of the Jury a Verdict of Not
  guilty shall be entered for the Defendant or Defendants.

PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS. _See_ _Newspaper Postage_.


PASTE BOWL.

A small wooden bowl to hold paste for the use of the press room; it
is usually the bowl of an old ball stock.


PEARL.

The name of a type, one size larger than Diamond, and one smaller
than Ruby. It is the smallest size that Moxon mentions.--_See_ TYPES.


PEEL.

[Illustration: A wooden peel]

An article to hang up the wet paper, upon the poles, to dry. The head
is made of thin wainscot, and the upper edge is the thinnest, and
rounded; the handle is of ash, with a groove cut in the upper end, to
receive the head, which is secured to it by wooden pins going through
the whole; and that part of the handle which receives the head is
planed down, so that at the upper end of it, it is rendered quite
thin, that there may be no shoulder to derange the paper. In large
offices they have them with handles of different lengths, to suit the
heights of the rooms in which paper is hung up to dry.


PELT POT.

Generally a large jar, in which urine is kept, to steep the pelts in
previous to making the balls; as also to steep the blankets in, in
which the balls are wrapped up at night. This only refers to pelt
balls, for where composition balls are used, this offensive article
is discarded.


PELTS.

Sheep skins untanned used for ball leathers.--_M._ The pelts that
were used previous to the introduction of composition, were sheep
skins, with the wool taken off, dressed with lime, and dried. They
are nearly superseded by composition balls and rollers.

When they are wanted for use, they are steeped in urine to soften
them, then rubbed through a twisted iron to supple them, and to take
out part of the moisture, which is termed currying; and afterwards
trodden under foot at the press side, by the pressman who is beating,
to expel the superfluous moisture; they are then scraped, to clean
the surface, and made up into balls, stuffed with carded wool, having
a lining made of a pelt taken from an old ball. This lining keeps the
outer skin moist, and makes the ball firmer on the stock.

The softer a pelt is, so long as it is not surcharged with moisture,
the better it will cover the surface of the type or engraving with
ink: and it will also retain on its surface particles of dust, wool,
or other extraneous matter, without parting with them to the letter
or engraving; so that the work will be better and clearer of picks,
than when the pelt is drier and harder.

In knocking-up balls, it is not necessary to tread the pelts, as is
usually done, and which is inconvenient when a man is working at half
press: it will answer equally well if the pelts be well curried, and,
after the balls are made, well scraped; which may be done by placing
the ball on the knees, with its handle against the stomach, to hold
it firm; then taking a sharp table knife, the handle of which is held
with one hand and the point with the other, and scraping from the
stock over the edge of the ball to the centre; by which operation
the superfluous moisture will be got rid of, and the ball will work
equally well as those that have been trod by the pressman.

It is customary for pressmen to throw aside pelts that are greasy,
and not to use them, till the last, in consequence of an opinion
general among them, that they will not take ink: but, from repeated
experiments that I have made, I could not perceive the least
difference between the most greasy pelts and those that were free
from grease; the one taking ink and retaining it on its surface,
equally as well as the other. Since then I have frequently mentioned
the subject to some of the most experienced pressmen, who all allow
that a greasy pelt is more durable than one clear of grease.

A greasy pelt requires more currying than one that is not greasy;
and it is better to let it remain longer in the pelt pot, currying
it occasionally, which act the pressmen term giving it exercise. It
is an advantage also to curry, occasionally, any pelts that are in
the pelt pot; as it improves their condition, and prevents their
spoiling, so soon as they would otherwise do, by being in soak, when
not immediately wanted.

In the country I have found it more convenient to get sheep’s skins
from the skinners, without any other preparation than having the wool
taken off; and these were more durable, and made softer and better
balls, than when dressed and dried in the usual way. _See_ CURRYING.


PENULTIMATE.

The last syllable but one of a word.


PERFECTING.

Printing the second form of a sheet; called also working the
reiteration.


PERFECT PAPER.

Paper sent in to print on, in which there is an extra quantity, to
allow for waste, &c.; thus a bundle consists of 43 quires, or 1032
sheets; and a ream of 21½ quires, or 516 sheets; without any outside
quires, and the whole consists of perfect sheets.

The second and fourth columns of these letters from the right hand
are used only when they are connected with a preceding letter. Every
letter should be connected with that which follows it, except these
seven; ا‎ _alif_, د‎ _dal_, ذ‎ _zal_, ر‎ _ra_, ز‎ _za_, ژ‎
_zha_, and و‎ _vau_, which are never joined to the following letter.

The short vowels are expressed by small marks, two of which are
placed above the letter, and one below it, as بَ‎ _ba_ or _be_, بِ‎
_be_ or _bi_, بُ‎ _bo_ or _bu_.

The mark ﹾ‎ placed above a consonant shows that the syllable ends
with it. The short vowels are very seldom written in the Persian
books; and the other orthographical marks are likewise usually
suppressed, except _Mudda_ ۤ ‎, _Humza_ٴ ,‎ and _Tushdeed_ ﹼ‎; the
two first of which are most common.

The most usual combination of letters are formed with خ‎ ج‎ چ‎
‎ح‎, which have the singular property of causing all the preceding
letters to rise above the line, as بخارا‎ _bokhára_, نحچير‎
_nakhcheer_, تصحيح‎ _tas-héeh_. The letters that precede م‎ _m_ are
also sometimes raised. Lam-alif لا‎ is compounded of ل‎ _l_ and ا‎
_a_.

The Arabic characters, like those of the Europeans, are written in
a variety of different hands; but the most common of them are the
Nuskhee, the Tâleek , or _hanging_, and the Shekesteh, or _broken_.
Our books have hitherto been printed in the Nuskhee hand, and all
Arabic manuscripts, as well as most Persian and Turkish histories,
are written in it; but the Persians write their poetical works in the
Tâleek, which answers to the most elegant of our Italic hands. As to
the Shekesteh, it is very irregular and inelegant, and is chiefly
used by the idle Indians, who will not take time to form their
letters perfectly, or even to insert the diacritical points; but this
hand, however difficult and barbarous, must be learned by all men of
business in India, as the letters from the princes of the country are
seldom written in any other manner.

_Numbers._--The following are the most common of the Persian
numbers:--

  +--------+-------------+------------------+

_Niskhi._--This is the form of writing used by the Arabians, who
invented the characters: as every Persian student should acquire a
knowledge of the Arabic, it ought therefore to be learned. This hand
is frequently employed by the Persians, and the history of Nader Shah
was written in it. The Niskhi is the parent of the Tâleek, and of all
the other hands in which the Arabic and Persian languages are now
written.

_Tâleek._--The Tâleek is the most beautiful hand writing used by the
Persians. In the manuscripts written in the Tâleek hand, the strokes
of the reed are extremely fine, and the initial letters ﺑ‎ ﺗ‎ ز‎
are scarcely perceptible. As the Persians always write their lines
of an equal length, they are obliged to place their words in a very
irregular manner; if the line be too short, they lengthen it by a
fine stroke of the reed; if too long, they write the words one above
another. In the Persian poems the transcribers place both members of
a couplet on the same line, and not the first above the second, as we
do: a Persian would write the following verses in this order:

      _With ravish’d ears_,      _The monarch hears_,
      _Assumes the god_,         _Affects to nod_.

It must be confessed, that this irregularity in writing, joined to
the confusion of the diacritical points, which are often placed at
random, and sometimes omitted, makes it very difficult to read
the Persian MSS., till the language becomes familiar to us; but
this difficulty, like all others in the world, will be insensibly
surmounted by the habit of industry and perseverance, without which
no great design was ever accomplished.

_Nustaleek._--The character called Nustaleek is compounded of
the Niskhi and Tâleek. It differs, however, considerably from
the graceful turns and beautiful flourishes of several of the
manuscripts. The Nustaleek character may be as easily read by
Europeans as the Niskhi.

_Shekesteh._--In this inelegant hand all order and analogy are
neglected; the points which distinguish ف‎ from ق‎, خ‎ from
‎ج‎, and ب‎ from ت‎, ث‎ and پ‎, &c., are for the most part
omitted, and these seven letters ا‎د‎ذ‎ر‎ز‎ژ‎و‎ are connected
with those that follow them in a most irregular manner. This is,
certainly, a considerable difficulty, which must be surmounted before
the learner can translate an Indian letter.

PICA.

The name of a type, one size larger than Small Pica, and one smaller
than English. In Moxon’s time seventy-five Pica bodies measured a
foot. All the sizes of types larger than Canon, are named from the
number of Pica bodies contained in their depth, as Four Line Pica,
Five Line Pica, and so on indefinitely. Leads or space lines are also
cast to proportionate parts of Pica, as four to Pica, six to Pica, &c.


PICK BRUSH.

A hard brush with rather fine hairs; it is used to brush picks
or dirt out of a form, when working, and each press is generally
supplied with one.


PICKER.

A fine pointed bodkin, or a needle, with which to take picks out of a
form.


PICKS.

When either pieces of the skin or film that grows on ink with
standing by, or any dirt, get into the hollows of the face of the
letter, that film or dirt will fill or choke up the face of the
letter, and print black; and is called a pick, because the pressman
with the point of a needle picks it out.--_M._


PIE.

When a page is broken, those broken letters are called pie. _See_
BROKEN LETTERS.--_M._ We now call it Pie when the letters are all
mixed indiscriminately together.

It is equally the interest of the employer and the workman to prevent
the accumulation of pie in a printing office, for it swallows up
useful sorts, to the delay, loss, and disappointment of both parties;
and if a strict method be not enforced to prevent its increase, a
master may be continually casting sorts; and at last it becomes an
Herculean task to clear it away. No receptacle for it should ever be
accessible to the workmen; and no types should ever be put into the
waste metal box but by the person who has the care of the materials,
that he may be enabled to prevent any abuse of this kind; for it
is too common a practice, both for boys and men, when an accident
happens, to throw a great part of the pie into the waste metal box,
to save themselves the trouble of distributing it.


PIG.

Pressmen are called pigs by compositors, sometimes by way of sport,
and sometimes by way of irritation; in the same way the press room is
called a pigstye. When the compositors wish to teaze them, they will
grunt when a pressman goes into the composing room; but they rarely
venture to do this in the press room. In Moxon’s time they were
called Horses. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.


PIGEON HOLES.

Wide whites between words, are by compositors (in way of scandal)
called pigeon-holes, and are by none accounted good workmanship,
unless in cases of necessity.--_M._ Cases of necessity do not
make them good workmanship; and the only instances in which they
are tolerated are when a page is small, and the type is large in
proportion to it, and in columns of table work. In marginal notes
they are avoided, by not of necessity spacing every line full out.


PILE OF BOOKS.

When a work is finished at the press, it is gathered, collated,
folded, and put into books, pressed, and then piled up in some
convenient part of the warehouse, in readiness for delivery.

The piles are erected as a stone mason would build, in layers of
four, five, six, or more books to each layer, according to the
number printed, and the convenience in the warehouse; the books
forming these layers are turned back and fore edge alternately, so
that a single copy can be readily got, and in removing them they are
less liable to get confused; the upper layer should always be laid
in a different order from that below it, so that the book should
invariably cross a joining of that under it; and when the pile is
high, I would recommend some wrappers to be placed occasionally
between the layers, they prevent the sides bulging out, and make the
pile firm. It is necessary to wrap up each parcel of the bottom layer
in brown paper or wrappers, to preserve the edges and backs of the
books clean. For the protection of this bottom layer, the pile should
be erected on a stage, or, in default of that, some wrappers and
waste paper should be spread on the floor upon which to place it; for
the pile should never be raised without something interposed between
the books and the floor.


PILE OF PAPER

is made similar to a pile of books; but, as the paper always comes
in to a printing office cased in wrappers, the precautions used
in keeping a pile of books clean are not necessary. The number
of bundles in the foundation will be determined by the quantity
received. The warehouseman should invariably mark the wrapper of each
bundle with the name of the work it is intended for, before it is
piled away.


PILE OF PRINTED PAPER.

During the progress of printing a work, the sheets are, after being
dried, placed in piles, generally resting against a wall of the
building.

When the sheets are taken down dry from the poles, they are knocked
up even, and piled against a wall generally, upon a stage to keep
the bottom of the pile out of the way of harm, or, in want of a
stage, upon some wrappers and waste paper to keep the bottom sheets
from the floor, one wrapper always placed so as to project and turn
over about a ream of paper, and turned into the heap, to preserve
the edges clean, the first signature being always at the bottom, and
the following ones piled in consecutive order upon it; between each
signature a label is inserted in front, with the name of the work and
the signature. What are called tops are placed on the pile, and some
waste paper, to preserve the top sheets from dust and other matters
that might soil them. It is usual to place the bottom a few inches
from, and to gradually incline it to, the wall, so that the upper
part may rest against it: this causes the pile to stand firmer than
it would do if piled perpendicularly.


MR. PITT’S MARK.

The printer’s name and residence affixed to printed books or other
articles, by the enactment of the act of parliament of 39 Geo. 3. c.
79., was technically so called.


PLANE DOWN.

To make the face of all the types in a form even, by passing the face
of the planer over them, and striking the back of it with a mallet.

When the quoins are pushed up with the fingers, previous to locking
the form up, I would plane it down gently, striking the back of the
planer with the side of my doubled hand, lifting the planer a little
up each time it is advanced; after the quoins are tightened round the
form, I would plane it down again gently with the mallet; and finally
with firmer blows after it is locked up; always lifting the planer
clear of the form at every advance that is made with it; if any thing
be under the form, it will be perceived when you plane down with the
hand; that part should be omitted being struck upon; and when the
form is locked up it ought to be lifted, the substance that is under
it taken away, the form then laid down again, the quoins of that
quarter slackened, and planed down: but types that stand up from any
cause should never be planed down while tightly locked up, as it is
almost a certainty that they will be destroyed.


PLANER.

A piece of beech wood, planed smooth and even on the face, to plane
the types in a form down with, by striking it on the top with a
mallet, to prevent any of them from standing up. It is usually made 9
inches long, 4¼ broad, out of 2 inch stuff, a little thicker in the
crown, and the edges hollowed the long way, to facilitate the lifting
of it about.


PLANETS.

The names of seven planets are used in some instances for the seven
days of the week, in the following manner:--

    The Sun, _Dies Solis_, is Sunday.

    The Moon, _Dies Lunæ_, is Monday.

    Mars, _Dies Martis_, is Tuesday.

    Mercury, _Dies Mercurii_, is Wednesday.

    Jupiter, _Dies Jovis_, is Thursday.

    Venus, _Dies Veneris_, is Friday.

    Saturn, _Dies Saturni_, is Saturday.

In the Journals of the House of Lords, they use the term _Dies
Sabbati_ for Saturday, that day being the original Sabbath. _See_
ASTRONOMICAL CHARACTERS.


PLANK.

That part of a wooden press which forms the bottom of the coffin; it
projects beyond the coffin where the tympan joints are placed, upon
which part the gallows sockets are fixed; on the bottom the cramp
irons; and to each end the girths, wherewith to run the carriage in
and out.


PLATEN.

The platen is commonly made of beechen plank, two inches and an half
thick, its length about fourteen inches, and its breadth about nine
inches.--_M._ This is the description of a platen for a two pull
press of the old construction: they are now always made of well
seasoned hard mahogany for wooden presses, thicker, and sometimes
faced with iron.

The platen is that part of the machine which comes down upon the
form, and, being acted upon by the spindle, produces the impression.
Iron presses have nearly superseded wooden presses, and have of
course iron platens; they are all one pull presses, and the platen
ought to be made large enough to cover the types of as large a form
as the press will contain. Whether they be of wood or of iron, the
face of the platen, that is, the under side, which produces the
impression, ought to be a true plane, as the least inequality in it
produces an unequal impression, which causes a great deal of trouble
at press to rectify it, more particularly in fine work.


PLATEN HOOKS.

Four iron hooks screwed into the corners of the platen.--_M._ To tie
it up by to the hose hooks. This is in wooden presses.


PLATEN PAN.

A square pan on the top of the platen, in which the toe of the
spindle works.--_M._ At present it is made round, of bell metal, with
a stud of hardened steel in it, for the toe of the spindle to work
on, and it fits into the platen plate with a square stem.


PLATEN PLATE.

A square plate of iron inlaid on the top of the platen in wooden
presses, in which is placed the platen pan.


PLATE PAPER.

This paper takes a good impression; but, without great care at press,
owing to its thickness and softness, it is by the process pressed
into the interstices between the lines, which produces an impression
of more than the surface, and, of course, of more than is wanted to
appear, particularly in engravings on wood: the skill of the artist
is thus rendered of little avail; and the delicacy and tone of the
engraving are destroyed.

To control this evil, when thick plate paper is used, I would advise
that it should be very slightly wetted; when a few impressions only
are wanted, putting the pieces into a heap of damp paper for a short
time will be sufficient; and to have only one thickness of stout
paper in the tympans. _See_ PAPER. WETTING PAPER.


PLAY WITH QUADRATS. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.--_M._ Also JEFF, and THROW.


PLURAL.

For the plural number of nouns, _See_ ORTHOGRAPHY.


POINTS.

Two thin pieces of iron, with points or spurs at one end, fixed to
the tympan with screws, to make register with. _See_ REGISTER SPUR.


POINTS. _See_ TYPOGRAPHICAL POINTS.


POINT HOLES.

The two holes the points prick in a sheet of paper.--_M._ These holes
are made by the point spurs when the white paper is working, and
are for the purpose of making register with when the reiteration is
worked by fitting these holes on the spurs, on the opposite side of
the sheet of paper.


POINTING.

When the Pressmen are working the reiteration, and have to place the
point holes, made when the white paper was worked, on the points, in
order to make both sides of the sheet in register, it is frequently
termed _Pointing_.


POINTS.

, ; : . - ? ! ( ’ ) [ * § † and other marks, are all by Printers
and Founders called Points.--_M._ We have now in addition the ‡ ‖ ¶
☞: but when we speak of points at the present day, it is generally
understood to mean those only which are used in punctuation, from
the comma to the apostrophe; the parenthesis and crotchet are spoken
of by their names; and the others are usually styled marks, or
references. For the uses of them, _See_ PUNCTUATION; and each point
or reference under its own name.


POINT SCREWS.

Two square headed and square shanked bolts with a screw at the end,
that go through the grooves in the tympan, with a nut on the upper
side, by which the points are firmly affixed to the tympan.


POLES.

To hang paper on to dry. They are about two inches and a half wide,
made of inch white deal, and are placed across the room, about
fourteen inches from the ceiling and nine or ten inches apart,
resting at each end on a long piece of wood fastened to the walls of
the room, in notches to retain them in their situations. They should
always be kept clean, and, if they have not had paper hung on them
for some time, the warehouseman should see that the dust be brushed
off them before any more is hung up. _See_ HANG UP PAPER. PEEL.


POLLING BACKWARD.

There are instances when a piece of work has been in the hands of
a companionship, and one of them has obtained a knowledge of the
following copy having some fat in it, a short page or a blank page
for instance, that he has delayed his own work in order to obtain
this fat; and thus lose perhaps two shillings, which he might have
earned in the time, to obtain an advantage to the amount of but one
shilling. This is termed _polling backwards_.

In addition the following letters are accented, viz., consonants, b́
ć, ł, ḿ, ń, ṕ, ś, ẃ, ż, ź; vowels, á, é, ó, ą, ę.

When b́, ḿ, ń, ṕ, are accented, it is necessary to soften them a
little by adding a very soft _i_, as drab́ (drab^i).

When ć is accented, it takes the sound of _ch_ French.

Ł, ł, has a peculiar pronunciation of its own, nothing equivalent to
it in English.

When ś is accented, it takes the sound of a very feeble French _ck_.

When ẃ is accented, it takes the sound of _f_, with a very feeble
_i_ added.

When ź is accented, it takes the sound of ś.

ż (pointed) is pronounced as _s_ in _pleasure_, or French _j_ in
_jamais_.

á is distinguished very little in pronunciation, but it serves to
show certain forms in the declensions.

ó is pronounced as _oo_, or French _ou_.

é approaches the sound of the mute _e_ in _que_, _je_, _le_.

ą is pronounced as the French nasal _on_.

ę is pronounced as the French nasal _in_.

k is used in all those foreign words which have originally a _c_
before the vowels _a_, _o_, _u_.

ẃ is used only at the end of words.

Q and V are used only in foreign proper names, &c. and are not
strictly to be considered as Polish letters.--_Grammaire Abrégée de
la Langue Polonaise, par Jean Séverin Vater. Halle et Strasbourg_,
1807.

Some Polish grammarians assert that the q is preferable to the q̦,
as being more consistent with the general sound of the letter, and
some books have been printed in which the q is substituted, but still
q, is by far the most generally used.


POOR LAWS AMENDMENT.

  4 & 5 Will. 4. c 76. s. 86. “And be it further enacted, That no
  Advertisement inserted by or under the Direction of the said
  Commissioners in the _London Gazette_ or any Newspaper, for the

PORTUGUESE.

The Portuguese alphabet contains twenty-four letters, being the same
as the English, with the exception of K and W, which are not in their
alphabet.

The tittle, or little dash, which the Portuguese call til, is set by
them over some letters instead of m; as bẽ instead of bem; convẽ
instead of convém; hũa instead of huma.

They also set their til ~ over the vowels ao, aa, in the end of
words, thus aõ aã.

It may be observed that the curved mark ~ is the most perfect, though
it is found necessary, in English types, frequently to substitute the
plain ‾ instead of the curved.--_Vieyra’s Portuguese Grammar, 9th
edit_.


POST HORSES.

  Penalty for forging Turnpike Tickets. By the Act 4 Geo. 4. c. 62.
  s. 41. it is enacted, “That if any Person shall falsely make,
  forge, or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made,
  forged, or counterfeited, or wilfully aid or assist in the false
  making, forging, or counterfeiting, any Ticket or Certificate by
  this Act authorized or directed to be used, with an Intent to
  defraud His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, or any Person or
  Persons, of any of the said Duties, or shall utter or publish as
  true any false, forged, or counterfeited Ticket or Certificate,
  with an Intent to defraud His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors,
  or any Person or Persons, of any of the said Duties, every Person
  so offending in any or either of the Cases aforesaid shall
  forfeit and pay the Sum of Fifty Pounds.”


PRE-ANTEPENULTIMATE.

The last syllable but three of a word.


PRESS.

The machine by means of which a printed impression of types and
engravings in relief is obtained.

It is a curious circumstance, that from the first introduction
of the art of printing in Europe, about 1440, till Earl Stanhope
made a great improvement, the principle of the press remained the
same, and even the construction of it underwent little alteration.
The principle is simple; a level surface attached to the end of a
screw, by which it is pressed upon the types with a sheet of paper
interposed to receive the impression. The improvements that Lord
Stanhope introduced were an increased power, by means of a compound
lever attached to the screw: this increased power was the means of
producing larger presses, which enabled the printers to print larger
sheets of paper than before, with one pull, even to the extent of a
double royal; and these new presses, being made of iron, produced
better workmanship than wooden ones, with less trouble, the wooden
platen being subject to be indented, which occasioned the impression
to be irregular; this required much time and trouble to equalize it,
particularly in fine work. This iron platen wears out types sooner
than the wooden platen. Many of our most splendid books were printed
with wooden presses. For some account of the most approved iron
presses, see under their respective names.

Although there are but few wooden printing presses now made, iron
presses having superseded them, yet, as there are many still in
being, it may be useful to retain the knowledge of fixing them in
a proper manner, on which account I shall give an old pressman’s
directions for this purpose.

“_To erect a Press_.--The feet must be horizontal, and the cheeks
perpendicular; then put the cap on the cheeks, and fix the stays as
firmly as possible between the cap and a solid wall, or a strong
beam: while the joiner is doing this, the pressman rubs well with
black lead the tenons of the head and winter, the mortises in the
cheeks, and all other parts where friction occurs. Place the winter
horizontally, and on it put the carriage which contains the ribs;
the joiner shortens or lengthens the fore stay under the carriage
till the ribs become horizontal; lay the coffin on the ribs; bed the
stone, which is a very particular point, as it must be perfectly
horizontal, and ought to be of equal thickness, and as smooth on the
under side as on the upper surface, so that if the face should be at
any time so indented as not to be fit for work, the same stone will
do by turning it over, and occasion very little trouble in bedding
it, and will not be so liable to break in working down as a new one.
Cartridge paper is the safest bedding, and stout tape laid even under
the stone is preferable to cords, as I know it is a preventive to
the stone breaking; and after it is bedded, the ends of the tape are
easier put between the coffin and the stone than cord.

“The head being put in, and the box with the spindle in it, fix the
shelves; then fix the platen; this must be done so exact as to touch
the face of all the type at one and the same time: the way to know
this, is by cutting four narrow slips of paper about six inches long,
and, taking care that there is no dirt on the stone nor on the bottom
of the form, plane it well down, place the four slips of paper, one
on each of the four corner pages; bring down the platen so gently,
that the corners of it may barely touch the slips of paper, with very
little pressure; if they all bind alike at one instant, the platen
hangs right; if not, alter the fixing till they equally bind.

“The rounce being set, and the upper and under bolsters made, the
pressman lays on a heavy form without blank pages, if he can get one;
and if it be a new press, he brings down the bar to the near cheek
regularly, until the press be properly wrought down. As he goes on,
the new scaleboards work close, and cause the press to lose power;
the pressman must continue adding more, until there be a sufficient
quantity in the head. If it be really necessary, put some scaleboards
under the winter, but the fewer the better. Pieces of felt hat are
preferable to scaleboards for loading the head of a press.

“I have always found the least slurring in presses that have solid
fixed winters, and have often abolished slurring and mackling in old
presses, by taking out all the scaleboard from beneath the winter,
and substituting solid blocks of wood. The mortises which contain
the tenons of the head ought always to be made long enough to
contain all the spring that is necessary for a good press.

“Attention being required, and much time lost in working down a new
press, two guineas are paid for doing justice to it.”


PRESS BAR.

A curved bar of iron, one end of which goes through an opening in the
spindle, and is secured by a screw in general, but sometimes by a
square iron bolt which goes through an opening in the end of the bar,
and as there is a shoulder that abuts against the square part of the
spindle, both these methods draw it tight up, and attach it firmly
to the spindle; at the other end there is a long, thick, tapering,
wooden handle, through which the bar goes, and it is either secured
by a screw, or the bar rivetted at the end with a collar round it.
The bar to screw the book press down with is also called a Press Bar.


PRESS BOARDS.

Boards made of deal, beech, elm, or mahogany, to place between paper
in the book press. They are made smooth on both sides, and it is
preferable to have them without a joint when it is practicable.


PRESS GOES.

When the pressmen are at work, the press is said to go.--_M_.


PRESS GOES EASY, LIGHT. _See_ EASY PULL.


PRESS GOES HARD, HEAVY. _See_ HARD PULL.--_M_.


PRESSMAN.

The man who executes printing at the press, and produces impressions
from types and engravings in relief.


PRESSMEN’S PRICES. _See_ SCALE.


PRESS PIN.

A small iron bar, wherewith to screw the book press down in the
warehouse, till there is some pressure on the paper, when it is wrung
down with the press bar.


PRESS PROOF.

A good impression of a sheet of a work, or of a job, to read it
carefully by, and to mark the errors, previous to its being put to
press.


PRESS STANDS STILL.

When the pressmen are not at work, or have nothing to do, the press
is said to stand still.


PRESS STONE.

A stone fitted into the coffin, on which the form is placed to be
printed. _See_ PRESS.


PRESSWORK.

Under the articles ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD and FINE PRESSWORK I have gone
into detail respecting the manner of producing superior workmanship;
it will not therefore be necessary to dwell at any great length upon
presswork generally. As the finest presswork is the impression from
the face of the types, and the face only, and there being little
elastic substance between the platen and the types, those which are
new, or not much worn, can only be used for this purpose. But as the
greater number of books, and other articles, are printed at a much
lower rate, the printer finds it necessary to use types that are
often much worn, with the angles rounded off by use; the pressman
is then obliged to have more blanket in the tympans, that their
elasticity may penetrate between the types, and produce an impression
from the rounded parts; he is obliged also to use a weaker ink, which
distributes easily and readily; it also requires less beating and
rolling; he is thus enabled to make greater despatch. The process of
making ready is the same in both, but in this instance is not carried
out to so much nicety, for the additional blankets preclude the
necessity; still the impression must be pretty equal; the making of
register is the same in both cases--page must fall exactly upon page;
neither does it require so great a pull; yet it is requisite that the
pressman should preserve the work of a proper colour, and that that
colour should be uniform.

PRINTING

is the art of producing impressions from the surface of engravings in
relief, whether those engravings are letters, diagrams, or pictorial
engravings.

This explanation applies to letterpress printing, to which this
work is confined, in contradistinction to copperplate printing. The
details of the practice are diffused through the whole book, and may
be referred to under their respective names.

The art of printing is the most important invention that was ever
introduced to the world, in its effects on the human mind, and of
consequence on all civilized society;--it preserves and disseminates
all discoveries and improvements in the arts and sciences; it
commemorates all other inventions; it hands down to posterity every
important event; it immortalizes the actions of the great and good;
and, above all, it extends and diffuses the word of God to all
mankind;--and yet this very art has left its own origin enveloped in
mystery and obscurity.

  31 Hen. 8. c. 14. intituled, “An Act for abolishing of diuersitie
  of opinions in certaine Articles concerning christian religion.”

  s. 4.----“It is therefore ordeined and enacted by the King our
  Souereigne Lord, the Lords spirituall and temporal, and the
  Commons in this present parliament assembled, and by authority
  of the same, That if any person or persons within this Realme of
  _England_, or any other the king’s dominions, after the xii. day
  of _July_ next coming, by word, writing, imprinting, ciphering,
  or in any otherwise, doe publish, preach, teach, say, affirme,
  declare, dispute, argue, or hold any opinion, that in the blessed
  Sacrament of the Altar, vnder the forme of bread and wine (after
  the Consecration thereof) there is not present really, the
  naturall body and blood of our Sauiour Jesu Christ, conceiued
  of the Virgin _Mary_, or that after the said consecration there
  remaineth any substance of bread or wine, or any other substance
  but the substance of Christ, God and man: or after the time
  aboue said, publish, preach, teach, say, affirme, declare,
  dispute, argue, or hold opinion, that in the flesh, vnder forme
  of bread is not the very blood of Christ: or that with the blood
  vnder the forme of wine, is not the very flesh of Christ, aswel
  apart as though they were both together: or by any the means
  abouesaid, or otherwise, preach, teach, declare, or affirme the
  said Sacrament to be of other substance than is abouesayd, or
  by any meanes contemne, depraue, or despise the said blessed
  Sacrament: that then every such person and persons so offending,
  their aiders, comforters, counsellers, consentors, and abettors
  therein, being thereof convicted in forme vnderwritten by the
  authority abouesaid, shall be deemed and adjudged heretikes.
  And that euery such offence shall be iudged manifest heresie:
  and that euery such offender and offenders shall therefore haue
  and suffer iudgement, execution, paine and paines of death, by
  way of burning without any abiuration, Clergie or Sanctuary, to

  offenders shall haue at the time of any such offence or offences
  committed or done, or at any time after, as in cases of high
  treason.”

  s. 6. “Also bee it enacted by the authoritie aforesaid, That if
  any person or persons after the said twelfth day of _July_, by
  word, writing, printing, ciphering, or otherwise then as aboue
  rehearsed, publish, declare, or hold opinion, that the said
  communion of the blessed Sacrament in both kinds aforesaid,
  is necessary for the health of mans soule to bee given or
  ministered in both kindes, and so ought or should bee given
  and ministred to any person, or ought or should bee so in both
  kindes receiued or taken by any person, other than by Priests
  being at Masse, and so consecrating the same as is aforesaid:
  or that any man after the order of Priesthood receiued as is
  aforesaid, may marrie or may make contract of matrimonie: or
  that any man or woman which aduisedly hath made or shall make
  avow to God of chastitie or widowhood, may marrie, or make
  contract of matrimony: or that priuate Masses be not lawfull or
  not laudable, or should not be celebrated, had, or vsed, nor

  is not expedient and necessary to be reteined and continued,
  vsed and frequented in the Church of God, euery person being
  for any such offence duely conuicted or attainted by the lawes
  vnderwritten, shall forfeit and lose to the King our Souereigne
  Lord all his goods and chattels for euer, and also the profits
  of all his lands, tenements, annuities, fees, and offices during
  his life, and all his benefices and Spiritual promotions shall

_Restrictions._--Ever since the introduction of printing into Europe,
the press has been subjected to great restrictions. To show the
nature of those restrictions in England, I have inserted two decrees
of the Star Chamber, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and the act 13 &
14 Charles 2. c. 33.; the principle of these was revived, with some
modification, by the Act 39 Geo. 3. c. 79.

To the 9th volume of the Statutes at Large is prefixed a Preface, or
Address from the Editor, Owen Ruffhead, to the Reader, from which the
following is on Extract.

  “What next claims our Observation is the memorable Act of 13 Car.
  2. c. 33. intitled ‘An Act for preventing Abuses in printing
  seditious, treasonable and unlicensed Books and Pamphlets; and
  for regulating Printing and Printing Presses.’ By this Act
  Printers are forbidden to publish any _heretical_, _seditious_,
  _schismatical_ or OFFENSIVE* Books, and all Books and Pamphlets
  are to be licensed by particular Licensers appointed according to
  the Nature of the Subject, and the Number of Printing Presses are
  hereby limited.

  [* “The Word OFFENSIVE is a Word of dangerous Latitude: But the
  Words are copied _literatim_ from the Star Chamber Decree, of
  which mention will be made hereafter.]

  “The Troubles which had subsisted in the late Reign, had given
  Birth to a free Spirit of political Inquiry, which this Statute
  was calculated to suppress: And it is observable, that this Act
  is founded on a decree of the _Star Chamber_†, made in the Year
  1637, which it copies without any material Variation, except
  that by the Decree, Offenders are to be punished as by the
  _Honourable Court of Star Chamber, or the High Commission Court,
  shall be thought fit_; whereas by the Act they are to be punished
  by Disability to exercise their Profession, and such farther
  Punishment, not extending to Life or Limb, as the _Justices of
  the King’s Bench_, or of _Oyer_ and _Terminer, &c._ shall think
  fit. It is remarkable, also, that the Preamble to this Decree of
  the Star Chamber takes Notice of divers Decrees and Ordinances
  made for regulating Printers and Printing in the Reign of Queen
  _Elizabeth_, which are said to have been defective in some
  Particulars. From hence we may see what early Attempts were made
  to restrain this invaluable Liberty. So intolerant is the Nature
  of Power, wherever lodged, that they who have loudest exclaimed
  against such Restriction as a Badge of Slavery, were no sooner
  invested with full Sway, than they began to work on the same
  Principles of Oppression. About the Year 1644, the Parliament
  made Ordinances for restraining the Press, which were framed on
  the Plan of the above Star Chamber Decree; and against which
  _Milton_ published a Treatise called Areopagitica.‡

  [† “This Decree is so scarce, that it is imagined there is only
  one Copy extant, which is preserved in a private Library.

  ‡ “There is an Edition of the _Areopagitica_ published by _A.
  Millar_ in 1738, with a sensible and spirited Preface, by Mr.
  Thomson, Author of the Seasons.]

  “This Act was last continued by 1 Jac. 2. c. 17. for seven Years
  from June, 1685; but being incompatible with the noble Principles
  of the Revolution, it has never since been, and it is to be hoped
  never will be, revived.”§

  [§ “It is impossible, however, on this Occasion, to avoid
  lamenting the many flagrant Instances wherein the Liberty of the
  Press has been lately abused by such wanton and indiscriminate
  Scurrility, as tends to make publick Censure lose its Effect, and
  render Men callous to the Stings of Reproof.”]


  _Decrees of the Lords in the Star Chamber, touching Printers,
  Stationers, &c. 23 Junii, Eliz. 28. 1585. Orders for them sent to
  Archbishop Whitgift._

  Whereas sundrie decrees and ordinances have, upon grave advice
  and deliberation, been made and published for the repressing
  of such great enormities and abuses as of late (most men
  in tyme past) have been commonlye used and practised by
  diverse contemptuouse and disorderly persons, professing the
  arte or misterie of printing and selling of books; and yet,
  notwithstanding, the said abuses and enormities are nothing
  abated, but (as is found by experience) doe rather more and
  more increase, to the wilful and manifest breach and contempt
  of the saide ordinances and decrees, to the great displeasure
  and offence of the queen’s moste excellent majestie; by reason
  whereof sundrie intolerable offences, troubles, and disturbances,
  have happened, as well in the church as in the civile government
  of the state and commonweale of this realme, which seem to have
  growen, because the paynes and penalties, conteyned and sett
  downe in the said ordinances and decrees, have been too light
  and small for the correction and punishment of so grievouse
  and heynouse offences, and so the offenders and malefactors in
  that behalfe have not been so severely punished as the qualitie
  of their offences hath deserved; her majestie, therefore, of
  her moste godlie and gracious disposicion, being careful that
  speedie and due reformacion be had of the abuses and disorders
  aforesaid, and that all persons using or professing the arte,
  trade, or mysterie of printing, or selling of books, should from
  henceforth be ruled and directed therein by some certeyn and
  knowen rules or ordinances, which should be inviolablie kept
  and observed, and the breakers and offenders of the same to be
  severely and sharplie punished and corrected, hathe straytly
  charged and required the most reverend father-in-God, the
  archbishop of Canterburie, and the right honourable the lordes,
  and others of her majesties privy council, to see her majesties
  said most gracious and godlie intention and purpose to be dulie
  and effectuallie executed and accomplished. Whereupon the said
  most reverend father, and the whole present in this honourable
  cowrte, this 23rd day of June, in the twenty-eighth year of
  her majesties reign, upon grave and mature deliberation, have
  ordeyned and decreed that the ordinances and constitutions, rules
  and articles, hereafter following, shall, from henceforth, by all
  persons, be duly and inviolablie kept and observed, according to
  the tenor, purporte, and true intent and meaning of the same,
  as they tender her majesties high displeasure, and as they wyll
  aunswere to the contrarie at their uttermoste peril. Videlicet.

  Imprimis, That every printer, and other person, or persons
  whatsoever, which at this tyme present hath erected, or set up,
  or hereafter shall erect, set up, keepe, mainteyn, or have anye

  damask-paper, or any such matters or things whatsoever, shall
  bring a true note, or certificate of the saide presses, or other
  printing instruments allreadie erected, within tenne days next
  coming, after the publication hereof; and of the saide presses,

  from tyme to tyme, within tenn dayes next after the erecting, or
  setting up thereof, unto the master and wardens of the companie
  of stacioners, of the cittie of London, for the tyme being, upon
  payne that everye person fayling, or offending herein, shall have

  2. Item, That no printer of bookes, nor any other person or

  any other thing or things whatsoever, but onelye in the cittie
  of London, or the suburbs thereof (except one presse in the
  universitie of Cambridge, and one other presse in the universitie
  of Oxforde, and no more) and that no person shall hereafter
  erect, sett up, or maynteyne in any secrett, or obscure corner,
  or place, any such presse or instrument before expressed; but
  that the same shall be in suche open place or places, in his or

  of Stationers, for the tyme being, or suche other person, or
  persons, as by the saide wardeins shall be thereunto appointed,
  may from tyme to tyme have readie accesse unto, to search for and

  other than onelye to worke as a journeyman for wages.

  3. Item, That no printer, nor other person or persons whatsoever,
  that hath sett up anye presse, or instruments for imprinting
  within six moneths last past, shall hereafter use, or occupie
  the same, nor any person or persons shall hereafter erect,
  or sett up any presse, or other instrument of printing, till
  the excessive multitude of printers, having presses alreadie
  sett up, be abated, diminished, and by death given over, or
  otherwise brought to so small a number of masters, or owners of
  printing-howses, being of abilitie and good behaviour, as the
  archbishopp of Canterburie and bishopp of London, for the tyme
  being, shall thereupon think it requisite, and convenient, for
  the good service of the realme, to have some more presses, or
  instruments for printing erected, and sett up; and that when, and
  as often as the said archbishopp and bishopp, for the tyme being,
  shall so think it requisite and convenient, and shall signifie
  the same to the said master and wardeins of the said companie
  of Stationers, for the tyme being; that then, and so often, the

  allwayes, that this article, or any thing therein conteyned,
  shall not extend to the office of the queene’s majesties printer

  offices, shall be, and continue at the pleasure and disposicion

  Pamphlets, and for Regulating of Printing and Printing Presses.

  “Whereas the well government and regulating of Printers and

PRINTING INK.

By 2 & 3 Will. 4. c. 84. printing ink pays a duty of Ten Shillings a
cwt. on being imported into this country. _See_ ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD.
FINE PRESSWORK. INK.


PROOF.

An impression of a sheet of a work, or of a job, to be examined to
see that it be correct.

Proofs are termed, according to circumstances, FIRST PROOF; CLEAN
PROOF; ITS OWN PAPER; and REVISE; for a description of which see each
article.


PROOF PAPER.

A low-priced paper, of which a stock is kept in printing offices to
pull proofs on, as well as to use for common jobs. A quire or two,
according to the extent of business, is always wetted ready for use
in the press room, where it is generally placed under a paper board
upon a table or bulk, sometimes in the heap that is working, to keep
it in better condition. It ought to be a hard sized, tough paper, and
should bear writing ink on it without allowing it to sink through.


PROOF PRESS.

_See_ EMPTY PRESS.--_M._ A press set apart to pull proofs at. It is
generally an old press, that has become from age and wear unfit for
regular business: the tympans are replaced by a thin iron frame,
pierced with holes, within which is stretched a blanket, drawn
tight by the edges and laced through these holes. This press is
commonly so inefficient, that when a good proof is wanted, it is
necessary to pull it at a press that is in working order. Some large
establishments have good presses to pull proofs at, and, where the
composing rooms are not on the same floor, have one in each room.


PSALM BOOKS.

For the allowance of the duty on paper used in the printing of psalm
books, _see_ PAPER.

  Penalty or Penalties, in such Manner as they in their Discretion
  shall think fit; the reasonable Costs and Charges of the Officers

PUNCTUATION.

The Greeks and Romans were unacquainted with grammatical punctuation.
With them it was for the most part only oratorical, since it
referred, excepting a point at the end of a sentence and at some
pauses, almost only to the elocution and pronunciation of the words.
The first very imperfect beginning of our punctuation occurs in the
time of Charlemagne, when a period of three points, and a stroke,
were made use of, yet without following any definite rule. About the
end of the fifteenth century, punctuation obtained a greater compass
and a more settled character through the learned Venetian printer
Manucci, so that he may be considered as the author of it. But still
much time elapsed before the marks of punctuation collectively came
generally into use as at present.

Through the introduction of these marks it has become possible to
read a book with facility, and to recite a poem with a musical
cadence. But still we feel too often, that our grammatical marks are
far from sufficient for the purposes of declamation, seeing that we
are sometimes obliged to make oratorical pauses where no grammatical
points are applicable, and sometimes to double the pause for one and
the same grammatical mark. Thus we read this passage in Wieland’s
“Goldene Spiegel,” pt. 1. p. 121.:--

“Diese Methode bildete gleisnerische Schurken, welche ausgelernte
Meister in der Kunst waren, ihre Leidenschaften zu verbergen,
ihre schlimmen Neigungen in schöne Masken zu vermummen, die
Unverständigen durch eine Tugend und Religion tödtende Phraseologie
zu täuschen.”--“This method created hypocritical rascals, who were
accomplished masters in the art of dissembling their emotions, of
disguising their evil propensities under fine masks, and of deceiving
the heedless by a virtue and religion killing phraseology.”

Here we readily perceive that after the word _Methode_, and
also after _eine_, a pause must be made in reading, although no
grammatical point is employed. And we have for this purpose no other
mark than the dash (--). In like manner, every reader will perceive
that the grammatical pause after _Schurken_ must be made much longer
than after _waren_, because this last is so closely connected with
the word immediately following, that the voice glides over it
rapidly. _Heinsius, German Grammar_.

The knowledge of punctuation being essential equally to the master
printer, the reader, and the compositor, I have extracted this
article from Murray’s English Grammar, as being perspicuous, and of
high authority.

“Punctuation is the art of dividing a written composition into
sentences, or parts of sentences, by points or stops, for the purpose
of marking the different pauses which the sense, and an accurate
pronunciation require.

“The Comma represents the shortest pause; the Semicolon, a pause
double that of the comma; the Colon, double that of the semicolon;
and the Period, double that of the colon.

“The precise quantity or duration of each pause cannot be defined;
for it varies with the time of the whole. The same composition may be
rehearsed in a quicker or a slower time; but the proportion between
the pauses should be ever invariable.

“In order more clearly to determine the proper application of the
points, we must distinguish between an _imperfect phrase_, a _simple
sentence_, and a _compound sentence_.

“An imperfect phrase contains no assertion, or does not amount to
a proposition or sentence: as, ‘Therefore; in haste; studious of
praise.’

“A simple sentence has but one subject, and one finite verb,
expressed or implied: as ‘Temperance preserves health.’

“A compound sentence has more than one subject, or one finite verb,
either expressed or understood; or it consists of two or more simple
sentences connected together: as, ‘Good nature mends and beautifies
all objects;’ ‘Virtue refines the affections, but vice debases them.’

“In a sentence, the subject and the verb, or either of them, may
be accompanied with several adjuncts: as, the object, the end, the
circumstance of time, place, manner, and the like: and the subject
or verb may be either immediately connected with them, or mediately;
that is, by being connected with something which is connected
with some other, and so on: as, ‘The mind, unoccupied with useful
knowledge, becomes a magazine of trifles and follies.’

“As sentences themselves are divided into simple and compound, so
the members of sentences may be divided likewise into simple and
compound members: for whole sentences, whether simple or compounded,
may become members of other sentences, by means of some additional
connexion; as in the following example: ‘The ox knoweth his owner,
and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people do
not consider.’ This sentence consists of two compounded members, each
of which is subdivided into two simple members, which are properly
called clauses.

“_Of the Comma_.

“The comma usually separates those parts of a sentence, which, though
very closely connected in sense and construction, require a pause
between them.

“RULE I. With respect to a simple sentence, the several words of
which it consists have so near a relation to each other, that, in
general, no points are requisite, except a full stop at the end of
it: as, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.’ ‘Every
part of matter swarms with living creatures.’

“A simple sentence, however, when it is a long one, and the
nominative case is accompanied with inseparable adjuncts, may admit
of a pause immediately before the verb: as, ‘The good taste of the
present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the
English language:’ ‘To be totally indifferent to praise or censure,
is a real defect in character.’

“RULE II. When the connexion of the different parts of a simple
sentence is interrupted by an imperfect phrase, a comma is usually
introduced before the beginning, and at the end of this phrase: as,
‘I remember, _with gratitude_, his goodness to me:’ ‘His work is,
_in many respects_, very imperfect. It is, _therefore_, not much
approved.’ But when these interruptions are slight and unimportant,
the comma is better omitted: as, ‘Flattery is _certainly_
pernicious;’ ‘There is _surely_ a pleasure in beneficence.’

“In the generality of compound sentences, there is frequent occasion
for commas; as will appear from the following view of the different
occasions to which they are adapted.

“RULE III. When two or more nouns occur in the same construction,
they are parted by a comma: as, ‘Reason, virtue, answer one great
aim:’ ‘The husband, wife, and children, suffered extremely*:’
‘They took away their furniture, clothes, and stock in trade:’ ‘He
is alternately supported by his father, his uncle, and his elder
brother.’

  * “_As a considerable pause in pronunciation, is necessary
  between the last noun and the verb, a comma should be inserted
  to denote it. But, as no pause is allowable between the last
  adjective and the noun, under_ Rule IV., _the comma is there
  properly omitted_. _See_ WALKER’S _Elements of Elocution_.

“From this rule there is mostly an exception, with regard to two
nouns closely connected by a conjunction: as, ‘Virtue _and_ vice form
a strong contrast to each other:’ ‘Libertines call religion bigotry
_or_ superstition;’ ‘There is a natural difference between merit
_and_ demerit, virtue _and_ vice, wisdom _and_ folly.’ But if the
parts connected are not short, a comma may be inserted, though the
conjunction is expressed: as, ‘Romances may be said to be miserable
rhapsodies, _or_ dangerous incentives to evil;’ ‘Intemperance
destroys the strength of our bodies, _and_ the vigour of our minds.’

“RULE IV. Two or more adjectives belonging to the same substantive
are likewise separated by commas: as, ‘Plain, honest truth, wants no
artificial covering;’ ‘David was a brave, wise, and pious man;’ ‘A
woman, gentle, sensible, well-educated, and religious;’ ‘The most
innocent pleasures are the sweetest, the most rational, the most
affecting, and the most lasting.’

“But two adjectives, immediately connected by a conjunction, are
not separated by a comma: as, ‘True worth is modest _and_ retired;’
‘Truth is fair _and_ artless, simple _and_ sincere, uniform _and_
consistent.’ ‘We must be wise _or_ foolish; there is no medium.’

“RULE V.. Two or more verbs, having the same nominative case, and
immediately following one another, are also separated by commas:
as, ‘Virtue supports in adversity, moderates in prosperity:’ ‘In a
letter, we may advise, exhort, comfort, request, and discuss.’

“Two verbs immediately connected by a conjunction, are an exception
to the above rule: as, ‘The study of natural history expands _and_
elevates the mind;’ ‘Whether we eat _or_ drink, labour _or_ sleep, we
should be moderate.’

“Two or more participles are subject to a similar rule, and
exception: as, ‘A man, fearing, serving, and loving his Creator;’ ‘He
was happy in being loved, esteemed, and respected;’ ‘By being admired
_and_ flattered, we are often corrupted.’

“RULE VI. Two or more adverbs immediately succeeding one another,
must be separated by commas: as, ‘We are fearfully, wonderfully
framed;’ ‘Success generally depends on acting prudently, steadily,
and vigorously, in what we undertake.’

“But when two adverbs are joined by a conjunction, they are
not parted by the comma: as, ‘Some men sin deliberately _and_
presumptuously;’ ‘There is no middle state; we must live virtuously
_or_ vitiously.’

“RULE VII. When participles are followed by something that depends on
them, they are generally separated from the rest of the sentence by
a comma: as, ‘The king, _approving the plan_, put it in execution;’
‘His talents, _formed for great enterprises_, could not fail of
rendering him conspicuous;’ ‘All mankind compose one family,
_assembled_ under the eye of one common Father.’

“RULE VIII. When a conjunction is divided by a phrase or sentence
from the verb to which it belongs, such intervening phrase has
usually a comma at each extremity: as, ‘They set out early, _and_,
before the close of the day, arrived at the destined place.’

“RULE IX. Expressions in a direct address, are separated from the
rest of the sentence by commas: as, ‘_My son_, give me thy heart;’ ‘I
am obliged to you, _my friends_, for your many favours.’

“RULE X. The case absolute, and the infinitive mood absolute, are
separated by commas from the body of the sentence: as, ‘His father
dying, he succeeded to the estate;’ ‘At length, their ministry
performed, and race well run, they left the world in peace;’ ‘To
confess the truth, I was much in fault.’

“RULE XI. Nouns in apposition, that is, nouns added to other nouns
in the same case, by way of explication or illustration, when
accompanied with adjuncts, are set off by commas: as, ‘Paul, the
apostle of the Gentiles, was eminent for his zeal and knowledge;’
‘The butterfly, child of the summer, flutters in the sun.’

“But if such nouns are single, or only form a proper name, they are
not divided: as, ‘Paul the apostle;’ ‘The emperor Antoninus wrote an
excellent book.’

“RULE XII. Simple members of sentences connected by comparatives,
are for the most part distinguished by a comma: as, ‘_As_ the hart
panteth after the water brooks, _so_ doth my soul pant after thee;’
‘_Better_ is a dinner of herbs with love, _than_ a stalled ox and
hatred with it.’

“If the members in comparative sentences are short, the comma is, in
general, better omitted: as, ‘How much _better_ is it to get wisdom
_than_ gold!’ ‘Mankind act _oftener_ from caprice _than_ reason.’

“RULE XIII. When words are placed in opposition to each other, or
with some marked variety, they require to be distinguished by a
comma: as,

      ‘Tho’ deep, yet clear; tho’ gentle, yet not dull;
      Strong, without rage; without o’erflowing, full.’

‘Good men, in this frail, imperfect state, are often found, not only
in union _with_, but in opposition _to_, the views and conduct of one
another.’

“Sometimes when the word with which the last preposition agrees, is
single, it is better to omit the comma before it: as, ‘Many states
were in alliance _with_, and under the protection _of_ Rome.’

“The same rule and restriction must be applied when two or more nouns
refer to the same preposition: as, ‘He was composed both under the
threatening, and at the approach, _of_ a cruel and lingering death;’
‘He was not only the king, but the father _of_ his people.’

“RULE XIV. A remarkable expression, or a short observation, somewhat
in the manner of a quotation, may be properly marked with a comma:
as, ‘It hurts a man’s pride to say, I do not know;’ ‘Plutarch calls
lying, the vice of slaves.’

“RULE XV. Relative pronouns are connective words, and generally admit
a comma before them: as, ‘He preaches sublimely, _who_ lives a sober,
righteous, and pious life;’ ‘There is no charm in the female sex,
_which_ can supply the place of virtue.’

“But when two members, or phrases, are closely connected by a
relative, restraining the general notion of the antecedent to a
particular sense, the comma should be omitted: as, ‘Self-denial is
the sacrifice which virtue must make;’ ‘A man who is of a detracting
spirit, will misconstrue the most innocent words that can be put
together.’ In the latter example, the assertion is not of ‘a man in
general,’ but of ‘a man who is of a detracting spirit;’ and therefore
they should not be separated.

“The fifteenth rule applies equally to cases in which the relative
is not expressed, but understood: as, ‘It was from piety, warm and
unaffected, that his morals derived strength.’ ‘This sentiment,
habitual and strong, influenced his whole conduct.’ In both of these
examples, the relative and verb _which was_, are understood.

“RULE XVI. A simple member of a sentence, contained within another,
or following another, must be distinguished by the comma: as, ‘To
improve time, whilst we are blessed with health, will smooth the bed
of sickness.’ ‘Very often, while we are complaining of the vanity,
and the evils of human life, we make that vanity, and we increase
those evils.’

“If, however, the members succeeding each other, are very closely
connected, the comma is unnecessary: as, ‘Revelation tells us how we
may attain happiness.’

“When a verb in the infinitive mood, follows its governing verb, with
several words between them, those words should generally have a comma
at the end of them: as, ‘It ill becomes good and wise men, to oppose
and degrade one another.’

“Several verbs in the infinitive mood, having a common dependence,
and succeeding one another, are also divided by commas: as, ‘To
relieve the indigent, to comfort the afflicted, to protect the
innocent, to reward the deserving, is a humane and noble employment.’

“RULE XVII. When the verb _to be_ is followed by a verb in the
infinitive mood, which, by transposition, might be made the
nominative case to it, the former is generally separated from the
latter verb, by a comma: as, ‘The most obvious remedy is, to withdraw
from all associations with bad men.’ ‘The first and most obvious
remedy against the infection, is, to withdraw from all associations
with bad men.’

“RULE XVIII. When adjuncts or circumstances are of importance, and
often when the natural order of them is inverted, they may be set
off by commas: as, ‘Virtue must be formed and supported, not by
unfrequent acts, but by daily and repeated exertions.’ ‘Vices, like
shadows, towards the evening of life, grow great and monstrous.’
‘Our interests are interwoven by threads innumerable;’ ‘By threads
innumerable, our interests are interwoven.’

“RULE XIX. Where a verb is understood, a comma may often be properly
introduced. This is a general rule, which, besides comprising some
of the preceding rules, will apply to many cases not determined by
any of them: as, ‘From law arises security; from security, curiosity;
from curiosity, knowledge.’ In this example, the verb ‘arises’ is
understood before ‘curiosity’ and ‘knowledge;’ at which words a
considerable pause is necessary.

“RULE XX. The words, _nay_, _so_, _hence_, _again_, _first_,
_secondly_, _formerly_, _now_, _lastly_, _once more_, _above all_,
_on the contrary_, _in the next place_, _in short_, and all other
words and phrases of the same kind, must generally be separated from
the context by a comma: as, ‘Remember thy best and first friend;
_formerly_, the supporter of thy infancy, and the guide of thy
childhood; _now_, the guardian of thy youth, and the hope of thy
coming years.’ ‘He feared want, _hence_, he over-valued riches.’ ‘His
conduct may heal the difference, _nay_, it may constantly prevent
any in future.’ ‘_Finally_, I shall only repeat what has been often
justly said.’ ‘If the spring put forth no blossoms, in summer there
will be no beauty, and in autumn, no fruit; _so_, if youth be trifled
away without improvement, riper years may be contemptible, and old
age miserable.’

“In many of the foregoing rules and examples, great regard must be
paid to the length of the clauses, and the proportion which they bear
to one another. An attention to the sense of any passage, and to
the clear, easy communication of it, will, it is presumed, with the
aid of the preceding rules, enable the student to adjust the proper
pauses, and the places for inserting the commas.


“_Of the Semicolon._

“The semicolon is used for dividing a compound sentence into two or
more parts, not so closely connected as those which are separated by
a comma, nor yet so little dependent on each other, as those which
are distinguished by a colon.

“The semicolon is sometimes used, when the preceding member of the
sentence does not of itself give a complete sense, but depends on
the following clause: and sometimes when the sense of that member
would be complete without the concluding one: as in the following
instances: ‘As the desire of approbation, when it works according
to reason, improves the amiable part of our species in every thing
that is laudable; so nothing is more destructive to them when it is
governed by vanity and folly.’

“‘Experience teaches us, that an entire retreat from worldly affairs,
is not what religion requires; nor does it even enjoin a long retreat
from them.’

“‘Straws swim upon the surface, but pearls lie at the bottom.’

“‘Philosophers assert, that Nature is unlimited in her operations;
that she has inexhaustible treasures in reserve; that knowledge will
always be progressive; and that all future generations will continue
to make discoveries, of which we have not the least idea.’


“_Of the Colon._

“The colon is used to divide a sentence into two or more parts, less
connected than those which are separated by a semicolon; but not so
independent as separate distinct sentences.

“The colon may be properly applied in the three following cases.

“1. When a member of a sentence is complete in itself, but followed
by some supplemental remark, or further illustration of the
subject: as, ‘Nature felt her inability to extricate herself from
the consequences of guilt: the gospel reveals the plan of Divine
interposition and aid.’ ‘Nature confessed some atonement to be
necessary: the gospel discovers that the necessary atonement is made.’

“2. When several semicolons have preceded, and a still greater
pause is necessary, in order to mark the connecting or concluding
sentiment: as, ‘A divine legislator, uttering his voice from heaven;
an almighty governor, stretching forth his arm to punish or reward;
informing us of perpetual rest prepared hereafter for the righteous,
and of indignation and wrath awaiting the wicked: these are the
considerations which overawe the world, which support integrity, and
check guilt.’

“3. The colon is commonly used when an example, a question, or
a speech is introduced: as, ‘The Scriptures give us an amiable
representation of the Deity, in these words: “God is love.”’ ‘He was
often heard to say: “I have done with the world, and I am willing to
leave it.”’

“The propriety of using a colon, or semicolon, is sometimes
determined by a conjunction’s being expressed, or not expressed: as,
‘Do not flatter yourselves with the hope of perfect happiness: there
is no such thing in the world.’ ‘Do not flatter yourselves with the
hope of perfect happiness; _for_ there is no such thing in the world.’


“_Of the Period._

“When a sentence is complete and independent, and not connected in
construction with the following sentence, it is marked with a period.

“Some sentences are independent of each other, both in their
sense and construction: as, ‘Fear God. Honour the king. Have
charity towards all men.’ Others are independent only in their
grammatical construction: as, ‘The Supreme Being changes not, either
in his desire to promote our happiness, or in the plan of his
administration. One light always shines upon us from above. One clear
and direct path is always pointed out to man.’

“A period may sometimes be admitted between two sentences, though
they are joined by a disjunctive or copulative conjunction. For
the quality of the point does not always depend on the connective
particle, but on the sense and structure of sentences: as,
‘Recreations, though they may be of an innocent kind, require steady
government, to keep them within a due and limited province. But such
as are of an irregular and vicious nature, are not to be governed,
but to be banished from every well-regulated mind.’

“‘He who lifts himself up to the observation and notice of the world
is, of all men, the least likely to avoid censure. For he draws upon
himself a thousand eyes, that will narrowly inspect him in every
part.’

“The period should be used after every abbreviated word: as, ‘M.S.
P.S. N.B. A.D. O.S. N.S.’ &c.


“_Of the Dash, Notes of Interrogation and Exclamation, &c._

“THE DASH.--The Dash, though often used improperly by hasty and
incoherent writers, may be introduced with propriety, where the
sentence breaks off abruptly; where a significant pause is required;
or where there is an unexpected turn in the sentiment: as, ‘If thou
art he, so much respected once--but, oh! how fallen! how degraded!’
‘If acting conformably to the will of our Creator;--if promoting the
welfare of mankind around us;--if securing our own happiness;--are
objects of the highest moment:--then we are loudly called upon, to
cultivate and extend the great interests of religion and virtue.’

      “‘Here lies the great--False marble, where?
      Nothing but sordid dust lies here.’

“Besides the points which mark the pauses in discourse, there
are others, which denote a different modulation of voice, in
correspondence to the sense. These are,

    “The Interrogative point, ?
    “The Exclamation point, !
    “The Parenthesis, ( )


“INTERROGATION.--A note of Interrogation is used at the end of an
interrogative sentence; that is, when a question is asked: as, ‘Who
will accompany me?’ ‘Shall we always be friends?’

“Questions which a person asks himself in contemplation, ought to be
terminated by points of interrogation: as, ‘Who adorned the heavens
with such exquisite beauty?’ ‘At whose command do the planets perform
their constant revolutions?’

“A point of interrogation is improper after sentences which are not
questions, but only expressions of admiration, or of some other
emotion.

“‘How many instances have we of chastity and excellence in the fair
sex!’

“‘With what prudence does the son of Sirach advise us in the choice
of our companions!’

“A note of interrogation should not be employed, in cases where it
is only said a question has been asked, and where the words are not
used as a question. ‘The Cyprians asked me, why I wept.’ To give this
sentence the interrogative form, it should be expressed thus: ‘The
Cyprians said to me, “Why dost thou weep?”’


“EXCLAMATION.--The note of Exclamation is applied to expressions of
sudden emotion, surprise, joy, grief, &c. and also to invocations or
addresses: as, ‘My friend! this conduct amazes me!’ ‘Bless the Lord,
O my soul! and forget not all his benefits!’

      “‘Oh! had we both our humble state maintain’d,
        And safe in peace and poverty remain’d!’

“‘Hear me, O Lord! for thy loving kindness is great!’

“It is difficult, in some cases, to distinguish between an
interrogative and exclamatory sentence; but a sentence, in which any
wonder or admiration is expressed, and no answer either expected or
implied, may be always properly terminated by a note of exclamation:
as, ‘How much vanity in the pursuits of men!’ ‘Who can sufficiently
express the goodness of our Creator!’ ‘What is more amiable than
virtue!’

“The interrogation and exclamation points are indeterminate as to
their quantity or time, and may be equivalent in that respect to a
semicolon, a colon, or a period, as the sense may require. They mark
an elevation of the voice.

“The utility of the points of interrogation and exclamation, appears
from the following examples, in which meaning is signified and

“PARENTHESIS.--A parenthesis is a clause containing some necessary
information, or useful remark, introduced into the body of a
sentence obliquely, and which may be omitted without injuring the
construction: as,

      “‘Know then this truth; (enough for man to know,)
        Virtue alone is happiness below.’
      “‘And was the ransom paid? It was; and paid
        (What can exalt his bounty more?) for thee.’

“‘To gain a posthumous reputation, is to save four or five letters
(for what is a name besides?) from oblivion.’ ‘Know ye not, brethren,
(for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath
dominion over a man as long as he liveth?’

“If the incidental clause is short, or perfectly coincides with the
rest of the sentence, it is not proper to use the parenthetical
characters. The following instances are therefore improper uses of
the parenthesis. ‘Speak you (who saw) his wonders in the deep.’
‘Every planet (as the Creator has made nothing in vain) is most
probably inhabited.’ ‘He found them asleep again; (for their eyes
were heavy;) neither knew they what to answer him.’

“The parenthesis marks a moderate depression of the voice, and may
be accompanied with every point which the sense would require, if
the parenthetical characters were omitted. It ought to terminate
with the same kind of stop which the member has, that precedes it;
and to contain that stop within the parenthetical marks. We must,
however, except cases of interrogation and exclamation: as, ‘While
they wish to please, (and why should they not wish it?) they disdain
dishonourable means.’ ‘It was represented by an analogy, (Oh, how
inadequate!) which was borrowed from,’” &c.




Q.


QUADRATS.

Pieces of type metal, of the depth of the body of the respective
sizes to which they are cast, and lower than types, so as to leave
a blank space on the paper, when printed, where they are placed: an
en quadrat is half as thick as its depth; an em quadrat is equal in
thickness and depth, and, being square on its surface, is _the_ true
quadrat, from _quadratus_, squared; a two em quadrat is twice the
thickness of its depth; a three em three times; and a four em four
times, as their names specify. Four ems are the largest quadrats that
are cast. They are used to fill out short lines; to form white lines;
and to justify letters, figures, &c., in any part of a line or page.

Four em quadrats are rarely cast larger than Pica; English and Great
Primer do not exceed three ems; nor does Double Pica exceed two ems.


QUARTER.

A gutter behind the tympan, under the joints, to carry the water away
beyond the farther side of the coffin that descends from the tympan.
It is about an inch higher on the near than on the off side, and
projects beyond the coffin about three inches.--_M._ It is not now
used, nor is it necessary, as we do not wet the tympan so much as to
cause the water to run off.


QUARTERS.

Quartos, octavos, and twelves forms are imposed in quarters. They are
called Quarters, not from their equal divisions, but because they are
imposed and locked up apart. Thus half the short cross in a twelves
form is called a Quarter, though it be indeed but one sixth part of
the form.--_M._ When both the crosses are in a chase, it is divided
into four parts; for some sizes, such as twelves and eighteens, they
are unequal; yet still each division is called a Quarter, whether it
contain more or less than the proportionate number of pages.


QUARTO.

A sheet of paper folded into four leaves or eight pages is styled a
Quarto.


QUI.

The established custom of the printing business in London is, for a
workman when he intends to leave his situation to give a fortnight’s
notice of his intention to quit; it is also the custom for the
employer, when he finds it necessary to part with a workman, to give
him a fortnight’s notice, except under particular circumstances of
neglect or dishonesty, when the discharge is instanter: this is
termed having _got the Bullet_; the fortnight’s notice to quit is
termed having _got the Qui_. The word appears to be a contraction of
_Quietus [est]_, which, being granted to a sheriff, discharged him of
all accounts due to the king. _See_ BULLET.


QUIRE.

A Quire of paper, for all usual purposes, consists of twenty-four
sheets, but for newspapers a Quire consists of twenty-five sheets,
and a ream of twenty Quires makes 500 sheets. This is done, I
believe, for the convenience of the Stamp Office.--_See_ PAPER.


QUOIN-DRAWER.

A drawer in the frame of the imposing stone, in which quoins are
kept; it is generally the right-hand top drawer, when you stand at
the front of the stone.


QUOIN A FORM.

The fitting of the Quoins in a form, so that when it is locked-up
they shall, in the most efficacious manner, wedge up and secure the
types. _See_ IMPOSING.


QUOINS.

Short pieces of beech wood, made of the same height as furniture, and
tapering in their width, to wedge the pages up with in a chase. They
are made of a variety of widths, from about two inches to less than
a quarter of an inch, for the convenience of having every gradation
in quoining a form.


QUOTATION.

A quotation “ ”. Two inverted commas are generally placed at the
beginning of a phrase or a passage, which is quoted or transcribed
from the speaker or author in his own words; and two commas, in their
direct position, are placed at the conclusion: as,

“The proper study of mankind is man.”--_Murray._

Murray’s “direct” commas are _superior_ commas, and consequently what
are technically called apostrophes.

We derive the use of inverted commas from France, where one
Guillemet was the author of them, to exclude the use of Italick
from quotations: as an acknowledgement for which improvement, his
countrymen called these inverted commas after his name, _Guillemets_;
whereas the Germans made a jest of their figure, and gave them the
name of _Gaenseaugen_, or Geese-eyes. _See_ APOSTROPHE.


QUOTATION QUADRATS

are cast the height of the Quotation. They are cast of different
bodies, that the Compositor may have choice of them to justify
his notes or quotations exactly against the designed line of the
page--_M._ They are now cast to correspond with a piece of broad
furniture one way, and with a narrow the other way, with spaces
of both widths cast to different thicknesses; these spaces are
called _Justifiers_, and the Quotation Quadrats are simply called
_Quotations_.




R.


RACKS,

to hang paper on.--_M._ Now called poles. _See_ BOARD RACK, CASE
RACK, POLES.


RAG.

When letter cast has a bur on any of its edges, that bur is called a
Rag.--_M._


RAILS. _See_ HIND POSTS.


RALPH. _See_ SPIRIT.


RANKS.

From the frames in a composing room being placed in a row, the
Compositors are said to be in the ranks; thus, if a compositor has
been selected for a reader, or overseer, and he afterwards works at
case as a compositor, it is said, _he is come to the ranks again_.


RAT.

A compositor, or pressman, who executes work at less than the regular
prices, or for less than the generality of the trade think it
deserves, or for less than the chapel decides it ought to be paid, or
for less than others are paid for it, becomes what is termed a rat;
the most miserable situation, perhaps, that a workman can be placed
in. He is hooted at and despised by the rest of the workmen in every
house where he may obtain employment; and this feeling towards him
does not subside, for the opprobrious epithet accompanies him for
life.


READER.

A person whose duty it is to read proofs in a printing office, for
the purpose of correcting the errors, that are unavoidable from the
nature of the process of arranging the types into words, lines, and
pages.

After the compositor has corrected these errors in the form, a
clean proof is pulled by the pressman, which, with the first proof,
comes, in the regular routine of the business, to the reader again,
to revise; that is, to compare the two carefully, to see that the
errors that were first marked have been corrected, and to notice
such as may have escaped the compositor’s attention, as well as any
additional ones that may have been made. The corrected proof is then
sent to the author or editor, and if he makes many alterations, it
is again corrected in the form; another proof is then pulled, which
comes again to the reader, who revises the author’s corrections, and
reads it very carefully for press, to detect any errors that may
have escaped the first reading, and also the author’s notice; when
it is laid on, the pressman pulls a revise, which is passed to the
reader, who again carefully revises it, to see that all the errors
are corrected, and that the margin and the workmanship are right,
previous to the sheet being printed off.

This is the usual routine in printing books; but in small
establishments, the duties of a reader are performed generally by the
overseer.

In large establishments, where there are several readers, I would
invariably have the first proofs of any given work read by one and
the same reader, and the press proofs also by one and the same but
a different reader; in this case there would be an arrangement made
between the readers, either orally or tacitly, with regard to the use
of capitals, the orthography, compound words, the division of words,
and the punctuation; an experienced compositor would consequently
very soon fall into the method, and, knowing how the work was to be
done, would have very little trouble with his proofs; and the whole
would proceed with regularity and uniformity, and be more correct,
than if the proofs had been indiscriminately given to any of the
readers who might happen to be disengaged at the moment.

If this plan were followed, much injury to the work as well as
vexation to the compositor would be avoided; for where the second
proofs fall into the hands of different readers, it must necessarily
happen that marks will be multiplied, from the different views which
men entertain on the same points where there are no positive laws
to refer to, but where arbitrary private judgment decides instead:
thus, one reader differs from another with respect to the use of
the capitals, as to the division of words, the orthography, and the
punctuation; thus harassing and teazing the compositor, who is never
certain under these circumstances what plan to follow, for what is
right to-day may be wrong to-morrow, and _vice versá_, besides the
pecuniary loss he suffers in making these alterations, in addition
to the deterioration of the work, from the want of uniformity and
consistency.

Many readers betray a want of remembrance of the sensitiveness of
authors, by endeavouring, with the best intentions, to improve their
language, and thus making unauthorized alterations in the proofs:
this causes an unpleasant feeling, and I have known the reader
accused of hypercriticism, and the original words restored; in other
instances I have known the reader to have been told that he did not
understand the author’s meaning, with a request that for the future
he would literally follow the copy, and leave it to the author to
make any alterations he might think proper. After a long experience I
have invariably found it the most satisfactory plan, when I perceived
a mistake, or met with a passage that I did not understand, or that I
thought incorrect, to draw a line under the words, and insert a query
in the margin, thus drawing the author’s attention to the part; if he
altered the passage, it was well, if he did not, the responsibility
was his; thus the author’s feelings were not wounded, and in most
cases he expressed his satisfaction at this method; but I never knew
an instance where any censure was expressed.

In making these general observations, I am actuated only by the
motive that printers should combine the desire to be correct with the
principle of conciliating the kind feelings of the author or editor.


REAM.

A ream of paper consists of twenty quires, each of twenty-four
sheets, with the exception of the two quires at the outside of each
ream, called Outside Quires or Corded Quires, which consist of
twenty sheets each, all damaged, torn, or imperfect, more or less:
this is the state in which paper is uniformly delivered by the
paper-maker from the mill. For private use it may be obtained from
the stationers made up with twenty inside quires, that is, of quires
of perfect paper; a ream in this state consists of 480 sheets. For
the purpose of printing, it is always sent to printing offices in a
state technically styled perfect, made up into bundles, each bundle
containing forty-three quires; thus a ream will consist of twenty-one
quires and a half, or 516 sheets; this surplus allows for accidents
in wetting, at press, and in the warehouse, as well as waste, and
enables the printer to deliver to the publisher the full count.
The outside quires are generally sold to bookbinders, but those
of writing-paper are used by stationers in making copy books and
memorandum books.


RECORDS.

In the year 1800, the House of Commons voted an Address to His
Majesty King George III. on the state of the Public Records of this
kingdom, and the necessity of providing for the better arrangement,
preservation, and more convenient use of the same; and humbly
represented that the Public Records of the kingdom are in many
offices unarranged, undescribed, and unascertained; that many of
them are exposed to erasure, alteration, and embezzlement, and are
lodged in buildings incommodious and insecure, and that it would
be beneficial to the public service that the records and papers
contained in many of the principal offices and repositories should be
methodized, and that certain of the more antient and valuable amongst
them should be printed; and humbly besought His Majesty, that He
would be graciously pleased to give such directions thereupon, as He
in His wisdom should think fit.

The first commission, bearing date the 19th of July 1800, states,
“that We, considering the premises, and earnestly desiring more
effectually to provide for the better arrangement, preservation, and
more convenient use of the said records and papers, and reposing
great trust and confidence in your fidelity, discretion, and
integrity;--

“Have authorized and appointed, and by these presents do authorize
and appoint you the said William Henry Cavendish Duke of Portland,
William Windham Baron Grenville, Henry Dundas, Henry Addington,
William Pitt, Sir Richard Pepper Arden, Frederick Campbell (commonly
called Lord Frederick Campbell), Sylvester Douglas, Sir John
Mitford, Sir William Grant, Robert Dundas, and Charles Abbot, and
any three or more of you, to make a diligent and particular inquiry
into the several matters which our faithful Commons have, in the
above-mentioned report of their proceedings, represented as fitting
to be provided for by our royal authority.

“And to the end that Our royal will and pleasure in the premises may
be executed with the greater regularity and expedition, We farther by
these presents will and command, and do hereby give full power and
authority to you or any three or more of you, to nominate and appoint
from time to time such person of ability, care, and diligence, as ye
shall think fit, to be and act as your Clerk or Secretary, for the
purpose of aiding you in the execution of these presents; and also to
nominate and appoint in like manner such several persons of ability,
care, and diligence, as ye may think fit, to be Sub-Commissioners,
to be employed under your direction and controul in the premises;
and more especially to methodize, regulate, and digest the records,
rolls, instruments, books, and papers, in any of Our public offices
and repositories; and to cause such of the said records, rolls,
instruments, books, and papers as are decayed and in danger of being
destroyed, to be bound and secured; and to make exact calendars and
indexes thereof; and to superintend the printing of such calendars
and indexes, and original records and papers as ye shall cause to be
printed.”

The Commissioners have in consequence published several volumes of
the Records, which contain documents of the highest importance to
the owner of landed property, to the family historian, and to the
topographical writer, as well as assist in the elucidation of the
manners and customs of the times to which they belong; while to the
general historian they are invaluable, as opening new sources of the
most valuable and authentic information, which previously had been
virtually closed against his researches.

The portions of the Records already published have been printed
literally from the originals, with all their abbreviations and
peculiarities preserved. This renders them difficult to be read by
the inexperienced in ancient manuscripts; and since county historians
and other topographical writers make frequent extracts from these
ancient records, to establish facts concerning persons, places, and
property, I have thought it useful to give a detailed article on
this subject, which may be equally useful in the library as in the
printing-office.

The Commissioners have also published several volumes of Calendars
and Indexes to many classes of Records.

To enter into a history, however brief, of the various public
Records, would be foreign to the objects of the present work: for
such information the reader is referred to publications that treat
especially upon the subject. It is sufficient for the purpose to
state, that each of the King’s Courts of judicature registers its
acts and proceedings upon rolls of parchment, which are called the
Records of the court to which they belong; for instance, the Chancery
Rolls, which contain the registration of all matters which pass under
the great seal of England, are divided into classes; particular
rolls being appropriated to the entry of particular matters. Thus,
the Norman Rolls contain entries chiefly relating to Norman affairs;
the Scotch Rolls comprehend those which regard Scotland generally;
the Parliament Rolls embrace matters touching the Parliament; the
Fine Rolls, entries respecting fines paid to the king for grants of
liberties and privileges. The Close Rolls preserve copies of letters
directed to individuals for their sole guidance and inspection,
which, being private, are for this reason folded up, and _closed_
with a seal; while the Patent Rolls, on the contrary, contain copies
of letters which, though bearing a seal on their lower margin as a
mark of authenticity, are not closed, but remain _patent_ or _open_,
to be shown to all men: these convey directions or commands of
general obligation, or are given to individuals for their particular
protection, profit, or personal advantage. A few only of the Chancery
Records have been here enumerated; but sufficient has been stated
to show the reader that each species of roll has its distinguishing
characteristic.

A _Chancery_ roll is composed of a number of skins of parchment so
connected that the top of the second is attached to the bottom of
the first, the top of the third to the bottom of the second, and so
on; the whole being rolled up in the manner of a piece of cloth in a
draper’s shop, or of carpet in the warehouse of the manufacturer.

The reader will, from this description, readily understand that the
word “roll” (_rotulus_, à _rotare_, to turn round) is but a synonym
of the word “volume” (_volumen_, à _volvere_, to roll), and that,
from the longitudinal connexion of its component skins, a reference
made from any entry upon it, to a preceding or succeeding one, will
be _literally_ and properly expressed by the words _vide_ SUPRA and
_vide_ INFRA. He will likewise clearly comprehend that not only the
interior, or _intus_, of the roll, upon which the characteristic
entries have been made, will necessarily be kept clean and free from
atmospheric influence, but also the greater part of the exterior,
which is denominated the _dors_. This circumstance afforded the
scribes an opportunity, which they readily embraced, of using the
_dors_ for entries and memoranda that were frequently very different
in their character from those contained on the _intus_ of the roll.

The Rolls of the courts of King’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer,
contain the proceedings of those Courts; and they differ from those
of the Chancery, not only in the nature of their contents, but
also in the form in which they are made up. A roll of these courts
consists of an indefinite number of skins sewn or attached together
with a strong ligature of parchment at the top, and the subject is
written both on the _intus_ and _dors_, precisely in the same way
as a book or letter is written; after the _intus_ is filled, the
subject is continued on the _dors_. In using this kind of roll, each
skin, when perused, is turned back over the head of the rest, and
brought down immediately after that which just before had been the
last of the series; until, the whole having been thus in their order
revolved, the first skin is again brought into its original position.
The entire mass, being unprotected by pasteboard or other unyielding
covers, is perfectly flexible, and, having been rolled up in the
manner of a quire of paper, which it is desired to reduce to its
smallest compass, is confined in its position by a piece of tape or
other adequate ligature.

For every regnal year of a King’s reign there is one or more of each
class of rolls appropriated; according to the quantity of business
done, so is the number of each class of rolls: for instance, the
Patent Rolls of the 1st of Edward the Fourth, extending to six rolls
or parts, as they are called, contain the enrolment of all the
Letters Patent made during that year; the Charter Rolls of the same
year, all the Charters granted in that year; as the Close Rolls do
all the Letters Close issued in that year.

In quoting an entry from a roll, it is usual for writers to state
first the name of the roll on which it is to be found: as, _Rot.
Pat._ (Rotulus Patentium), _Rot. Claus._ (Rotulus Clausarum), the
word “Litterarum” being understood in the two preceding cases;
_Rot. Fin._ (Rotulus Finium), &c. Then follows the year of the
king’s reign. Should the roll be divided into parts, the part also
is specified; as, _p._ 1. or _pars_ 1., _p._ 2. or _pars_ 2. The
next circumstance noticed is the particular skin or _membrane_ on
which the entry occurs; as, _m._ 23. If the entries on the skin have
numbers attached to them, the number also (_n._ 1., &c.) is cited:
and if the entry is made on the back or _dors_ of the roll, that
circumstance is expressed by adding _d._ or _in dorso_ (_i. e_. “on
the back”) to the quotation; for, should this be omitted, the entry
will very naturally be sought for upon the _intus_ of the roll.
Citing, then, an entry, from the Patent Rolls for instance, we will
suppose the quotation to run in the following form, “Rot. Pat. 13
Edw. III. p. 2. m. 23.;” which would be thus rendered in English: “On
the twenty-third skin of the second part of the Patent Roll of the
thirteenth year of Edward the Third.”

Before quitting this part of the subject, it may not be unimportant
to state that, on examining a roll, it is not an unfrequent
circumstance to meet with entries which are cancelled, or crossed
out with the pen; but, to prevent suspicion that this has been
unfairly done, the reason for the cancellation is generally added at
the side: as, “Quia supra,”--“Because it has already been entered
above;” “Quia alias inferius,”--“Because it has been re-entered in
other words below;” “Quia in Rot. Fin.”--“Because it is entered
on the Fine Roll” (to which roll it more properly belongs); &c.
This kind of cancellation, which was performed, as of course, by
the person who discovered the error, must not be confounded with a
cancellation by _judgment_; which latter was a function of the Lord
Chancellor, who, when Letters Patent or Charters were adjudged void,
was the person who condemned or cancelled them.

The terms _cancellation_, _erasure_, _expunging_ or _expunction_,
_obliteration_, _elision_, and _deletion_,--words each employed to
denote a different method adopted to prevent faulty passages or
minor errors from standing as parts of a composition,--having been
frequently used indiscriminately one for another, the reader may not
be displeased to be here reminded of their original significations.
To treat, then, of each in the order in which it has been named;--

_Cancellation_ denotes the drawing a pen several times obliquely
across a passage, first from right to left, and then from left to
right, in the manner of lattice-work. (The word is derived from
_cancella_, a lattice.)

_Erasure_ implies the removal of a faulty portion by the application
of the knife. (From _erado_, I scrape out.)

_Expunging_ or _expunction_ (both derivations from the same verb,
_expungo_, I prick or _dot_ out,) was a method by which the clerk
neatly expressed that a word, or part of a word, was to be omitted;
as “sentenṭẹṇce.” Leaving out, then, the under-dotted, or
expuncted letters, the amended word will be _sentence_.

_Obliteration_ is the slovenly method, still frequently employed, of
completely covering the error with ink, so that not a letter thereof
can be traced. (From _oblitero_, I blot out.)

_Elision_ is the act of striking out the erroneous matter by a simple
dash of the pen. (From _elido_, I strike or dash out.)

_Deletion_ is the wiping away the ink while it is yet wet, and then
continuing the writing over the space which had been in the first
instance occupied by the error. (From _deleo_, I wipe out.)

After this short, but, it is hoped, satisfactory explanation of
the nature and circumstances of a roll, the reader will proceed to
an analysis of the contracted language in which records have been
composed.

  The marks placed above letters to denote omissions are either a
  right line (¯), or a circumflex (~). The former of these marks
  above a _vowel_ denotes that an immediately subsequent _m_ or
  _n_ has been omitted; as, vēdāt for _vendant_, bonū for
  _bonum_, terrā for _terram_: the latter mark, when seen above
  or through a letter, whether in the middle or at the end of a
  word, signifies that some letter other than _m_ or _n_ is to
  be supplied, as ṽl for _vel_, ip̃e for _ipse_; or that more
  letters than one are required, as aĩa for _anima_, al̃r for
  _aliter_, Wintoñ for _Wintonia_, nob̃ for _nobis_, mand̃ for
  _mandatum_. The circumflex is sometimes continued over or through
  two letters; as, occo͠e for _occasione_, nll͠m for _nullum_. Some
  persons, however, employ the straight line through a consonant,
  instead of the circumflex, to denote the omission of one or more
  letters; as, vob̵ for _vobis_, qd̵ for _quod_.

  A small letter placed _above_ the line (hence called a _superior_
  letter) indicates an omission of which such letter forms a part;
  as, don^c for _donec_, p^{i}us for _prius_, q^{o}s for _quos_, s^a
  for _supra_, t^i for _tibi_.

  The four following double characters occur in Sir Francis
  Palgrave’s “Parliamentary Writs,” in each of which the superior
  immediately surmounts its subjacent letter, having been cast with
  it by the founder as if they had been but one character:--ṁ, for
  _mihi_; ṅ, for _nisi_; q̇, used for _qui_ and _quia_; ṫ, for
  _tibi_.

  The apostrophe is sometimes used as a mark of abbreviation,
  generally after an initial capital, but sometimes also in other
  parts of the word.

  A point or dot, placed after a letter, is frequently used as a
  sign of final abbreviation; as, ass. no. diss, for _assisæ novæ
  disseisinæ_, di. t̃ fi. s. for _dilecto et fideli suo_, e. for
  _est_, plurib. for _pluribus_.

  The signification of the following characters is fixed and
  positive:--

    Ɂ This symbol, sometimes called the _c_ cursive, or _c_
    reversed, denotes _com_ or _con_: as, Ɂmitto, _committo_; Ɂtra,
    _contra_. Before the adoption of the present elegant type,
    this character was represented in printing by an old-fashioned
    figure of 9; as, 9mune, _commune_. In the “Parliamentary
    Writs,” a turned _c_ supplies its place; as, ↄpetere,
    _competere_.

    [#] This represents the _es_ plural and _is_ possessive in the
    termination of Old English nouns: in later times it was much
    used for the _is_ final of Latin genitives. In the extract
    from Richard of Devizes, immediately to be given, it has been
    uniformly thus employed.

    ę This character, which resembles the cedilla of the French
    (ç), is sometimes employed as the representative of the
    diphthong _æ_ in particular records; as, terrę, _terræ_.

    [#] or [#] Each of these characters represents _est_, simple or
    in composition; as, simple, [#] _est_; in composition, inter[#]
    _interest_.

    ẽ or e̚ These also denote _est_: they sometimes stand for
    _ess_; as, ẽe, _esse_; e̚et, _esset_.

    &, 7, and t̃ are abbreviated forms of the conjunction _et_.
    They were not, however, used indiscriminately, as in the
    subsequent praxis, but are peculiar to MSS. of very different
    periods of time.

    t̃c̃. _et cætera_.

    &̄ _etiam_.

    ƪ This ascending recurved flourish, which is sometimes cast
    separately by the founder, that it may be placed after a
    simple consonant, but which is most frequently cast with it,
    both forming together one compound character, denotes the
    omission of _er_ or _re_: as, cƪno or c̉no, _cerno_: gƪens or
    g̉ens, _gerens_: gƪgis or g̉gis, _gregis_: camƪa or cam̉a,
    _camera_: remunƪo or remun̉o, _remunero_: pƪter or p̉ter,
    _præter_ (Note.--_Per_, which has its specific symbol, is never
    represented by this character): sƪviens or s̉viens, _serviens_:
    tƪra or t̉ra, _terra_: tƪmens or t̉mens, _tremens_: fuƪit or
    fủit, _fuerit_: vƪsus or v̉sus, _versus_: duxƪit or dux̉it,
    _duxerit_;--x̉ stands also for _xor_, as uxƪem or ux̉em,
    _uxorem_. When _er_ is omitted after one of the ascending
    letters _b_, _d_, or _h_, its absence is generally denoted
    by the circumflex line drawn across the upright stem of the
    letter: as tab̃na, _taberna_; consid̃atum, _consideratum_;
    h̃es, _hæres_.

    Đ This character, when alone, represents _De_, when the word
    begins a sentence.

    đ The small đ, when alone, likewise denotes _de_; and in
    accounts it represents one of the cases of _denarius_. It may
    also be used arbitrarily; and then, like all letters standing
    alone, its meaning must be discovered by an examination of the
    context.

    ɱ A contracted form of _manucaptor_ or _manerium_. It is an
    arbitrary sign, and may represent other words, the sense of
    which must be sought from the context.

    ⅌ or p̵ This is the specific representative of _per_: but it
    sometimes also denotes _par_ and _por_; as, p̵te, _parte_;
    temp̵e, _tempore_.

    ⅊ This character uniformly represents _pro_.

    ɋ This, annexed to a word, denotes the postpositive conjunction
    _que_.

    q̵ _quod_.

    Q₂ or q₂ _quia_.

    ℞ _Rex_ and its cases; also _Regina_ and its cases.

    ꝝ This character, which is found at the end only of a word,
    usually represents the _rum_ of plural genitives: it is
    sometimes, however, used as a general termination; as, Alienoꝝ
    for _Alienoram_, Eboꝝ for _Eborum_ or _Eboracum_, Windesoꝝ for
    _Windesores_.

    ʄ This character, which occurs mostly in Old French,
    represents, in composition, the syllable _ser_; as, ʄvaunt,
    _servaunt_: alone it means _sire_; with a superior ^r, ʄ^r,
    _seigneur_.

    þ _th_ Saxon: as, þƪ, _ther_; þ^t, _that_.

    ð Another form of the Saxon _th_.

    ꝰ This symbol is the representative of the final _us_, except,
    as an almost general rule, when terminating datives: as,
    Augꝰti, _Augusti_; Deꝰ, _Deus_; mandamꝰ, _mandamus_; priꝰ,
    _prius_. It also denotes _os_ or _ost_ in the preposition
    _post_; thus, pꝰ or pꝰt

    ʒ The usual function of this abbreviation is that of denoting
    the _us_ final of datives; as, tribʒ, _tribus_; omnibʒ,
    _omnibus_: but it likewise represents the final _et_; as, debʒ,
    _debet_; habʒ, _habet_: and sometimes stands for a general
    termination; as, quilʒ, _quilibet_; scilʒ, _scilicet_. For the
    last purpose it is still in ordinary use, but under a disguised
    form; as viz. _for_ viʒ.

    Xp̃c Latin names derived from the Greek are usually printed
    with the Roman letters which most nearly resemble in their form
    those of the original language: thus X stands for the Greek
    _chi_ (Χ), p for the _rho_ (Ρ), and c for the _sigma_ (Σ). Xp̃c
    consequently represent the word “Christus”: by substituting the
    required letter for the c, we shall have the various cases of
    the noun; as, Xp̃i, Xp̃o; _Christi_, _Christo_, &c.

    ✠ The cross is met with in some records and charters, and in
    such cases generally precedes the subscription of his name
    by a bishop. It is not used as a word, but apparently as a
    compendious profession of faith, or else as a silent invocation
    of the Divine aid. This was also the sign by which persons who
    could not write were accustomed to attest instruments, their
    names being added by those who could. An imitation of this mark
    is still in use among uneducated persons; as, “John [his X
    mark.] Thomas,”

    The following points are met with in ancient MSS.

    , the comma; sometimes also used as a period.

    ; the ancient colon, or semicolon: used frequently as a full
    stop.

    [#] This character denotes the commencement of a paragraph in
    Domesday-book.

    [#] and [#] These marks are, in some records, placed at the
    commencement of sections and of independent lines.

The necessity of printing records in the most literal manner
having been for a long time generally admitted, Editors have been
constrained to invent characters by which to denote erasures,
cancellations, interlineations, and other peculiarities which occur
upon the face of them. These characters, though strictly editorial,
are nevertheless deserving of notice here.

    _Cancellations_, using the term in a comprehensive sense, are
    denoted by Sir F. Palgrave, in his “Parliamentary Writs,” by
    placing an upright trefoil (_trèfle_--the club of the French
    playing-cards) at the commencement of the elided passage, the
    conclusion of which he indicates by a reversed trefoil: thus,
    T. ℞ ap̃ ♣ap̃d[#] Westm̃.

    _Interlineations_ are expressed by their being included between
    brackets: [ ].

    _Words written upon erasures_, or apparently added to the
    text after it had been originally written, are placed between
    inverted commas: “ ”.

Sir Francis likewise employs critical marks, by which he directs
attention to _evident_ as well as _apparent_ errors in the original,
as also to the point at which an _apparent deficiency_ exists.

    _Doubtful readings_, and words which are _apparently_ clerical
    errors, are preceded by the upright parallel, ‖.

    Readings which are _evidently_ erroneous are stigmatized by the
    obelisk or dagger, †.

    And _apparent deficiencies_ are denoted by the insertion of an
    asterisk, *, at the point where the omission appears to have
    taken place.

    ∿ and • These two characters occur also in the last-named work,
    the meaning of which is by no means clear. They appear to be
    imperfect imitations of private marks made by the writers of
    the documents.

Mr. Hardy, in his “Close Rolls,” has adopted a system somewhat
different from that of Sir F. Palgrave.

    All errors, whether of commission or omission, the first-named
    gentleman denotes by drawing a line under the wrong word, or
    under the interspace in which the omission should have been
    inserted; leaving the ascertainment of the kind of error to the
    discrimination of the reader.

    Elisions of _one_ or a _few_ words are represented in his work
    by means of thin wire placed over the surface of these words,
    which are grooved by a file for the purpose of its reception,
    and which, when thus printed, have the appearance of having
    been dashed out with a pen. Cancellations of greater extent are
    indicated by including the cancelled matter between two thick
    perpendicular lines, curved at their extremities and formed
    like the printer’s brace, but without its receding middle.
    These, for convenience, are here exhibited in the horizontal
    position ╭╌╮ ╰╌╯.

    Words written on an erasure are printed between these marks ` ´.

  To assist the reader in comprehending the foregoing explanations,
  and as an exercise to his ingenuity, an interesting tale, of
  sufficient length for the purpose, has been selected from the
  History of Richard the First. This _historiette_, which was
  written by the monarch’s namesake, Richard of Devizes, and which
  abounds in very interesting particulars, was lately, for the
  first time, given to the public in a printed form by the “English
  Historical Society:” to their publication we are indebted for our
  text. The reader, having carefully studied the preceding symbols,
  may now proceed to an examination of the language of this story.
  This, which has been purposely contracted with every species of
  abbreviations common to the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th
  centuries, he will proceed to extend into full words, verifying
  his performance, when completed, by comparing it with what
  immediately follows, which he will find to be the same narrative
  in an uncontracted form. Having acquired some degree of facility
  in extending the contracted forms, he may then advantageously
  reverse the process, and proceed to a reduction of words at
  length to a contracted state. A little practice will soon enable
  him to apply his newly acquired knowledge in the elucidation of
  whatever form of record or of ancient document may come before
  him. This acquirement he may find extremely useful, and he may
  possibly thence derive a certain degree of distinction; since
  this has to the present time been a branch of knowledge entirely
  confined to a small portion of the learned, and to the few
  typographical readers whose employments have more immediately
  required its cultivation. A translation is added, followed by a
  few explanatory notes.

  In conformity with a practice which has hitherto much obtained
  in Record printing, _c_ has been substituted for _t_ in the
  terminations _tio_ and _tia_: this usage, the propriety of which
  has been questioned, has been here followed, in order that the
  student’s eye may be accustomed to its recurrence elsewhere.
  The diphthongs _æ_ and _œ_ have been also for the same reason
  represented by the simple _e_.

  Quia Wintonia non debuit debita sibi mercede privari pro servata,
  ut in capite libri præpositum est, pace Judæis, Wintonienses
  Judæi civitatis suæ (Judaico more) studentes honori, etsi
  factum forte defuerit, plurimis facti indiciis celebrem sibi
  famam de martyrizato a se in Wintonia puero confecerunt. Casus
  erat hujusmodi. Puerum quemdam Christianum, artis sutoriæ
  sciolum, Judæus quidam in familiare familiæ suæ consciverat
  ministerium. Non ibi continuum residebat ad opus, nec magnum
  aliquid semel sinebatur explere, ne provisam sibi cædem probaret
  cohabitatio; et ut, pro modico labore melius ibi quam pro multo
  alibi remuneratus, domum dæmonis, donis ejus et dolis illectus,
  libentius frequentaret. Fuerat autem Francus genere, pupillus
  et orphanus, abjectæ conditionis et paupertatis extremæ. Has
  hujusmodi miserias in Francia male miseratus quidam Judæus
  Francigena, crebris ei monitis persuasit ut Angliam peteret,
  terram lacte et melle manantem; Anglos liberales prædicavit et
  dapsiles; ibi nullum, qui niteretur ad probitatem, pauperem
  moriturum. Puer promtulus, ut naturaliter Francorum est, ad velle
  quicquid volueris, assumpto secum comite quodam coætaneo suo et
  compatriots, ad peregrine proficiscendum præcinctus est; nihil in
  manibus habens præter baculum, nihil in sytarchia præter subulam.

  Valedixit Judæo suo; cui Judæus, “Vade,” ait, “viriliter. Deus
  patrum meorum deducat te sicut desidero.” Et, impositis manibus
  super caput ejus, ac si esset hircus emissarius, post stridores
  quosdam gutturis et tacitas imprecationes, jam de præda securus,
  adjecit, “Forti animo esto, obliviscere populum tuum et terram
  tuam, quia omnis terra forti patria est, ut piscibus æquor,
  ut volucri vacuo quicquid in orbe patet. Angliam ingressus si
  Londonias veneris, celeriter pertransibis; multum enim mihi
  displicet illa polis. Omne hominum genus in illam confluit ex
  omni natione quæ sub cœlo est; omnis gens sua vitia et suos mores
  urbi intulit. Nemo in ea sine crimine vivit; non omnis in ea
  vicus non abundat tristibus obscenis; eo ibi quisquis melior est,
  quo fuerit major in scelere. Non ignoro quem instruo; habes supra
  tuam ætatem fervorem ingenii, frigiditatem memoriæ, ex utrinque
  contrariis temperantiam rationis. Nihil de te mihi metuo, nisi
  cum male viventibus commoreris; ex convictu enim mores formantur.
  Esto, esto! Londonias venies. Ecce! prædico tibi, quicquid in
  singulis, quicquid in universis partibus mundi mali vel malitiæ
  est, in una illa civitate reperies. Lenonum choros non adeas,
  ganearum gregibus non immiscearis; vita thalum et tesseram,
  theatrum et tabernam. Plures ibi quam in tota Gallia thrasones
  offendes, gnathonum autem infinitus est numerus. Histriones,
  scurræ, glabriones, garamantes, palpones, pusiones, molles,
  mascularii, ambubaiæ, pharmacopolæ, crissariæ, phitonissæ,
  vultuariæ, noctivagæ, magi, mimi, mendici, balathrones, hoc
  genus omne totas replevere domos.[1] Ergo, si nolueris habitare
  cum turpibus, non habitabis Londoniis. Non loquor in literatos
  vel religiosos, sive Judæos; quamvis et ex ipsa cohabitatione
  malorum, minus eos ibi quam alibi crediderim esse perfectos.

  “Nec eo pergit oratio, ut in nullam te recipias civitatem,
  cum meo consilio nusquam tibi sit nisi in urbe manendum,
  refert tamen in qua. Si igitur circa Cantuariam appuleris,
  iter habebis perdere; si vel per eam transieris. Tota est illa
  perditorum collectio ad suum nescio quem nuper deificatum,
  qui fuerat Cantuariæ archipresbyter, quod passim præ inopia
  panis et ocio per plateas moriuntur ad solem. Rovecestria et
  Cicestria viculi sunt, et cur civitates dici debeant præter
  sedes flaminum nihil obtendunt. Oxonia vix suos clericos, non
  dico satiat, sed sustentat. Exonia eodem farre reficit homines
  et jumenta. Bathonia, in imis vallium in crasso nimis aere et
  vapore sulphureo posita, imo deposita, est ad portas inferi.
  Sed nec in arctois sedem tibi legeris urbibus, Wigornia,
  Cestria, Herefordia, propter Walenses vitæ prodigos. Eboracum
  Scottis abundat, fœdis et infidis hominibus vel homuncionibus.
  Eliensis pagus perpetuo putidus est pro circumfusis paludibus.
  In Dunelmo, Northwico, sive Lincolnia, perpaucos de potentibus,
  de tua conditione nullum penitus audies Romane loquentem. Apud
  Bristollum nemo est qui non sit vel fuerit saponarius, et omnis
  Francus saponarios amat ut stercorarios. Post urbes, omne forum,
  villa, vel oppidum, incolas habet rudes et rusticos. Omni insuper
  tempore pro talibus Cornubienses habeto, quales in Francia nosti
  nostros Flandrenses haberi. Ceterum regio ipsa generaliter in
  rore cœli et in pinguedine terræ tota beatissima est; in singulis
  etiam locis aliqui boni sunt, set multo minus in omnibus quam in
  una Wintonia.

  “Hæc est in partibus illis Judæorum Hierosolyma, in hac sola
  perpetua pace fruuntur, hæc est schola bene vivere et valere
  volentium. Hic fiunt homines, hic satis est panis et vini pro
  nihilo. Sunt in ea tantæ monachi misericordiæ et mansuetudinis,
  clerus consilii et libertatis, cives civilitatis et fidei, feminæ
  pulchritudinis et pudicitiæ, quod parum me retinet quin ego
  vadam illuc cum talibus Christianis fieri Christianus. Ad istam
  te dirigo civitatem, urbem urbium, matrem omnium, et omnibus
  meliorem. Unum est vitium et illud solum, cui de consuetudine
  nimis indulget. Salva pace literatorum dixerim et Judæorum,
  Wentani mentiuntur, ut vigiles, sed in fabulis faciendis. Nusquam
  enim sub cœlo de tam facili tot rumores falsi fabricantur, ut
  ibi; alias, per omnia sunt veraces. Multa haberem adhuc et
  de meis negotiis tibi dicere, sed ne forte non capias, vel
  obliviscaris, literulas has familiaris mei Judæi manibus inseres,
  credo quia et ab illo aliquando remuneraberis.” Scripta brevis
  erat Hebraica. Judæus peroraverat; et puer, omnia interpretatus
  in bonum, pervenit Wintoniam.

  Subula sibi sicut et sodali suo satisfecit ad victum, et male
  parta per literas Judæi sæva suavitas et blæsa benignitas ad
  solatium. Ubicumque diebus pauperculi operarentur ab invicem,
  vel comederent, singulis noctibus in uno unius vetulæ veteri
  tugurio in uno lectulo quiescebant. Dies succedunt diebus, menses
  mensibus; et hujusmodi pueri nostri, quem tam curiose hucusque
  diduximus, adesse per abesse festinant tempora. Crucis adoratæ
  dies advenerat, et puer ipso die apud Judæum suum operans,
  quocumque modo de medio factus, non comparuit. Erat quippe
  proximum Pascha, dies festus Judæorum. Socius illius vespere
  non revertentis ad cubiculum miratus absentiam, plurimis ipsa
  nocte terretur insomniis. Quæsitum diebus aliquot per omnes
  urbis angulos cum non invenisset, convenit Judæum simpliciter,
  si suum quoquam misisset nutritium; quem cum præter solitum de
  tam benigno pridie vehementer sensisset acerbum, verborum et
  vultus varietate notata, incanduit illico, et, ut erat vocis
  acutæ et mirabilis eloquentiæ, statim prorupit in jurgia, magnis
  eum de sublatione socii sui clamoribus urgens. “Tu,” inquit,
  “fili sordidæ meretricis, tu latro, tu traditor, tu diabole,
  tu crucifixisti socium meum. Hei mihi! modo quare non habeo
  vires hominis! Ego te manibus meis dilaniarem.” Audiuntur in
  platea clamores vociferantis in æde, concurrunt undique Judæi
  et Christiani. Puerulus instat, et jam pro turba constantior,
  interpellatis præsentibus, cœpit allegare pro socio. “O vos,”
  ait, “viri qui convenistis, videte si est dolor sicut dolor
  meus. Iste Judæus diabolus est, iste cor meum de ventre meo
  rapuit, iste unicum sodalem meum jugulavit, præsumo etiam quod
  manducavit. Filius quidam diaboli, Judæus, Francigena, nec
  intelligo, nec experior, Judæus ille dedit sodali meo literas
  mortis suæ ad hominem istum. Ad hanc urbem venit inductus, imo
  seductus. Judæo huic sæpe servivit, et in domo ejus novissime
  visus est.” Non defuit ei testis ad aliqua, quantum et femina
  Christiana, quæ, contra Canones, in eadem domo nutrierat
  Judæulos. Constanter jurabat se vidisse puerum in penum Judæi
  descendere sine regressu. Judæus inficiatur, res refertur ad
  judices. Deficiunt accusatores; puer quia infra ætatem erat,
  femina quia infamem eam fecerat Judæorum ministerium. Judæus
  obtulit purgationem conscientiæ propter infamiam. Judicibus aurea
  placuit. Dedit Phinees et placavit, et cessavit quassatio.


_Translation._

  As it would have been wrong that Winchester should be deprived
  of her due reward for having preserved peace with the Jews, as
  has been stated at the beginning of this book[2], the Winchester
  Jews, studious (after a Jewish fashion) of their city’s honour,
  although clear evidence of the deed was perhaps wanting, yet from
  several indications of its commission, gained for themselves a
  notorious celebrity by the martyrdom of a lad in Winchester.
  The circumstance was as follows: A certain Jew had engaged a
  Christian boy, who was a little acquainted with shoemaking,
  in the domestic service of his family. He did not remain
  permanently at work in the house, nor was he allowed to perform
  any great matter at once, lest cohabitation with the family
  should show him the destruction prepared for him; as also, that,
  being better remunerated for a little labour there than for much
  elsewhere, he should, enticed by his presents and deceit, the
  more willingly resort to the demon’s house. Now the boy was a
  native of France, a minor and an orphan; he was, too, of low
  condition and extreme poverty. A French Jew, hypocritically
  pitying this his state of wretchedness while in France, persuaded
  him by repeated exhortations to seek England, a land flowing
  with milk and honey: he extolled the English as liberal and
  munificent; adding, that no one who would struggle for an honest
  living in that country could die poor. The lad, rather ready,
  as is natural with the French, to conform his will to that of
  others, taking with him a companion of his own age and country,
  girt up his loins for a foreign journey; carrying nothing in his
  hand except a staff, nor anything in his scrip besides an awl.

  He took leave of his friend the Jew, who thus addressed him. “Go
  thy way,” says he, “manfully. May the God of my fathers be thy
  leader, according to my desire.” And having laid his hands upon
  his head, as if he had been the scape-goat, being now certain of
  his prey, he added, after certain guttural croakings and silent
  imprecations, “Be of a stout heart: forget thy people and thy
  country, for every land is as his country to the brave, even
  as is the sea to fish, as to the bird whatever lies before it
  on the open globe. On landing in England, shouldst thou go to
  London, thou wilt pass through it quickly, for much doth that
  city displease me. Every kind of men from every nation under
  heaven flows into that place; into that town hath every people
  carried its vices and its habits. No one lives there untainted
  with crime; there is not a street within that place which abounds
  not with sad obscenity; a man is there accounted better in
  proportion as he has been a greater adept in iniquity. I am not
  ignorant of whom I instruct: thou hast a glow of genius beyond
  thy years, a coolness of reflection, and, as the result of these
  opposite qualities, a temperateness of the reasoning faculty. I
  have no fear for thee unless thou dwell with evil-livers, for
  from our associations are our morals formed. Amen! amen! thou
  wilt go to London. Lo! I tell thee beforehand, whatever there
  is of evil or of wickedness in particular parts of the world,
  whatever in all its parts together, in that one city wilt thou
  find. Go not among the multitude of the corrupters of youth;
  mix not with the crowds issuing from the stews; flee dice and
  chess, the playhouse and the pothouse. Thou wilt meet there more
  bullies than are in the whole of France, and yet the number of
  mean flatterers is infinite. Stage-players, buffoons, bald-pated
  reprobates, men living like wild Indians, parasites, infamous
  boys, effeminate and scandalous men, lewd music girls, quacks,
  wantons, fortune-tellers, harpies, night-walkers, conjurers,
  mimics, beggars, shabby scoundrels,--this is the sort of people
  with which each house is filled. If, then, thou wouldst not be
  a dweller with men of shame, thou wilt not abide in London. My
  observations are not directed against men of letters or the
  religious, nor against Jews; though, from their very cohabitation
  with the wicked, I should believe them to be farther from
  perfection there than anywhere else.

  “Nor does my advice go the length of dissuading thee from
  betaking thyself to a city, since in my opinion thou shouldst
  tarry nowhere but in some large town; it is of consequence,
  however, in which. If then thou shouldst land near Canterbury,
  thou wilt be on the road to destruction; if even thou pass
  through it. All that collection of lost men is so devoted to
  the service of some lately deified person of their place (I
  know not whom)[3], who was archbishop of Canterbury, that they
  are dying everywhere in the sun, for want of bread and through
  indolence, in the very streets. Rochester and Chichester are mere
  villages and offer nothing for which they should be called cities
  except their being bishops’ sees. Oxford scarcely, I do not say
  satiates, but keeps her clerks alive. Exeter feeds men and beasts
  with the same meal. In the depths of valleys, in an exceedingly
  dense atmosphere and amid sulphurous vapours, Bath is posited,
  yea deposited, at the gates of hell. But neither wilt thou select
  for thyself an abode in the northern cities, in Worcester,
  Chester, or in Hereford, on account of the Welsh, men prodigal of
  human life. York abounds with Scots, who are filthy and deceitful
  men, or something less than men. From its surrounding marshes,
  the Isle of Ely is one eternal stench. In Durham, Norwich, or in
  Lincoln thou wilt hear very few of the higher orders speaking
  Latin; of thine own condition, not a soul. At Bristol there is
  not a man who is not, or has not been, a soap-boiler: now a
  Frenchman loves soap-boilers as well as he does nightmen.[4] Out
  of the large towns, every market-town, vill, or petty town has
  rude and clownish inhabitants. Thou mayst, moreover, at all times
  consider the Cornishmen to be such as thou knowest our Flemings
  to be esteemed in France. In fine, the country generally is in
  the highest degree blessed with the dews of heaven and with
  richness of soil: there are, too, some good men in every place
  within it, but fewer by far in all together than in Winchester
  alone.

  “That city is the Jerusalem of the Jews in those parts: within
  her precincts alone do they enjoy perpetual peace; she is the
  school of those who wish to live well and to thrive. There men
  are produced; there thou mayst have a sufficiency of bread and
  wine for nothing. In that place there are monks of such mercy and
  meekness, a clergy so wise and tolerant, citizens of such probity
  and so regardful of their fellows’ rights, women so beautiful
  and modest, that little withholds me from going thither, and,
  among such Christians, myself becoming a Christian. To that
  city do I direct thee, the city of cities, the mother of all
  and better than all. There is one vice, and only one, in which
  she is accustomed to over-indulge. Asking pardon of the men of
  letters and the Jews, I must say (that thou mayst be upon thy
  guard) that the Winchester people are addicted to lying, yet only
  in inventing idle tales; for in no place under heaven, as there,
  are so many false reports fabricated with so much facility;
  in all other matters they are perfectly veracious. I had yet
  much to tell thee of my own affairs; but lest thou shouldst not
  comprehend all, or shouldst forget, thou wilt place this small
  letter in the hands of a Jewish friend, as I feel confident that
  thou wilt one day be rewarded by him.” This was a brief note
  written in Hebrew. The Jew had finished his oration; and the
  lad, putting the best construction upon everything, arrived at
  Winchester.

  His awl provided food enough for his companion and himself; and
  the cruel kindness and stuttering civility so evilly obtained
  him by the Jew’s letter procured him comforts. Wherever these
  poor creatures might work separately in the day, or take their
  meals, they each night rested on a little bed in the ancient
  cottage of an aged woman. Day succeeds day, month month, and
  the last hours of this our youth, whom we have thus far so
  curiously traced, hasten, by their very escape, their arrival.
  The day of the Adoration of the Cross[5] had arrived; and the
  boy, working upon that day at his master the Jew’s, in whatever
  manner he was made away with, disappeared. Now the next day was
  the Passover, the great festival of the Jews. His companion,
  wondering at his absence, as he did not return in the evening to
  his bed, is terrified that night by many hideous dreams. Having
  for several days sought him in every corner of the city without
  finding him, he at once asked the Jew if he had sent the lad,
  who was his means of support, anywhere; whom when he perceived
  to become, contrary to his wont, from the particularly mild man
  of yesterday, outrageously bitter,--noticing this change in his
  language and his countenance, he immediately took fire, and as
  he had a piercing voice, and was gifted with a wonderful flow
  of words, he instantly broke out into reproaches, with loud
  outcries charging him, with making away with his friend. “Thou
  offspring of a filthy harlot!” he exclaims, “thou thief! thou
  traitor! thou devil! thou hast crucified my companion! Woe is
  me! why have I not yet the strength of a man! I could tear thee
  in pieces with my hands.” The cries of the boy vociferating
  within the house are heard in the public street; from all sides
  Jews and Christians hastily assemble. The boy presses; and,
  now become more confident from the presence of the crowd, he
  began, having gained their attention, to plead the cause of
  his companion. “O men,” he says, “who have here assembled, see
  if there be grief like my grief. This Jew is a devil; he hath
  torn my heart from within my breast; he hath murdered my only
  companion, I even think he hath devoured him. A son of the
  Evil One, a certain Jew,--whether he be French-born I neither
  understand nor know,--but that Jew gave to my friend a letter,
  which was the warrant for his death, directed to this man. Thus
  induced,--yea, seduced,--he came to this city. He was often
  engaged in the service of this Jew, and in his house was he last
  seen.” The boy was not without a witness to some portion of his
  tale; inasmuch as there was a Christian woman, who, contrary to
  the Canons, had nursed the Jewish children in the same house.
  She swore positively that she had seen the lad go down into the
  Jew’s store-room, but never return. The Jew denies it; the matter
  is referred to the Judges. The accusers fail; the boy because he
  was under age, the woman because her ministry to the Jews had
  rendered her infamous. The Jew offered a purgation[6] of his
  conscience with respect to the infamy. Gold was acceptable to the
  judges: Phinees gave it and appeased them, and the stir ceased.

[1] Some of these worthless characters are mentioned in the lines of
Horace:

      “Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolæ,
      Mendici, mimi, balatrones.”--_Sat._ lib. i. 2.

Others are to be found in Juvenal.

[2] The atrocious massacre above referred to, is related in the
following impious and inhuman terms:--“On that same day of the
coronation, about the solemn hour in which the Son was immolated to
the Father, they began in the city of London to sacrifice the Jews to
their father the devil; and so long was the duration of this famous
mystery, that the holocaust could scarcely be completed on the second
day. Other cities and towns in the country emulated the faith of the
Londoners, and with equal devotion dispatched their bloodsuckers in
their blood to the infernal regions. Somewhat, but not to such an
extent, was at that time enacted against those children of perdition
everywhere throughout the kingdom: Winchester alone spared her
vermin,--a people prudent and forecasting, and a city at all times
respecting her citizens’ rights.”--“Eodem coronationis die, circa
illam sollemnitatis horam qua Filius immolabatur Patri, incœptum est
in civitate Londoniæ immolare Judæos patri suo diabolo; tantaque fuit
hujus celebris mora mysterii, ut vix altera die compleri potuerit
holocaustum. Æmulatæ sunt aliæ civitates regionis et urbes fidem
Londoniensium, et pari devotione suos sanguisugas cum sanguine
transmiserunt ad inferos. Aliquid, sed inæqualiter, ea tempestate
contra perditos paratum est ubique per regnum: sola tantum suis
vermibus pepercit Wintonia, populus prudens et providus, ac civitas
semper civiliter agens.”

[6] It was the custom, where sufficient testimony could not be had,
to allow the accused to clear himself from the charge by his oath:
this was sailed _purgation_. The oath having been made, twelve
persons, called _compurgators_, were produced on the prisoner’s
behalf, who swore, that, from what they knew of his general
character, they believed his oath. This was deemed satisfactory.

REFERENCES.

There are various references used for notes, according to the fancy
of the author, or the master printer; where they are not numerous in
a page, the common references are generally used, in this order-- *,
†, ‡, §, ‖, ¶, and where there are more than six notes in a page,
two of each reference are put to a note; but this is looked upon as
having an unsightly appearance.

Italick lower case letters are sometimes used, enclosed between
parentheses (_a_), and sometimes figures (1); the letters, when they
are used, are often continued through the alphabet, and then commence
again with (_a_).

The most usual references, and which are esteemed the neatest, are
superiors, both letters and figures; where the notes are at the
foot of the page, letters are most frequently used, sometimes going
through the alphabet, and sometimes commencing with ^a in each page
in which notes occur: where the notes are placed at the end of
the volume, figures ^{1 2} are nearly always adopted, in regular
succession.


REGISTER.

This term implies such an arrangement of the whites in both forms of
a sheet, as that, when printed off, the pages shall fall precisely at
the back of each other, so that the sides and heads of the pages of
one form shall not project beyond those of the other; in fine work
the principle is carried still further, and the whites in the pages
are so arranged that line shall fall upon line, when the reiteration
is worked. _See_ GAUGE. SPACE LINES.


REGISTER SHEET.

The sheet or sheets printed to make register with.--_M._ When works
are printed on fine and expensive paper, register is usually made
with proof paper; and it is not till the form is completely made
ready that they use its own paper.


REGLET.

Is a sort of furniture of an equal thickness all its length. It is
quadrat high, of several thicknesses, viz. Nonpareil, Brevier, Long
Primer, Pica, &c. thick.--_M._

Reglet and all other furniture, except side and foot sticks, are
made in lengths of three feet each, and are always styled a yard of
reglet, a yard of broad, &c.; the use of reglet is to branch out
titles, jobs, and other matter, to economise the use of quadrats:
it is preferable to quadrats for this purpose, it keeping the lines
more even; for different founts of the same size being often mixed,
and the quadrats frequently battered, are not so true as a piece of
reglet, which I would always have put next to a line of capitals; it
is also used in making margin.

The thinnest reglet used is called card reglet, a substitute for
scale-board; the regular sizes commence with Pearl and go up to Two
Lines Great Primer, with the exception of Ruby, Minion, Bourgeois,
Small Pica, English, Paragon, and Two Lines Pica, which are sizes not
used.


REITERATION.

The second form, or the form printed on the backside of the white
paper.--_M._ This is a term generally used for press work; when the
second form is working, that is, perfecting the sheet, the pressmen
say they are working the reiteration.


REVIEWS. _See Newspaper Postage._


REVISE.

An impression of each form printed on proof paper the first thing
after it is laid on, and taken by the pressman to the reader or
overseer, for him to examine that all the corrections in the press
proof are made, previously to the impression being worked off. The
compositor frequently takes the revise for waste paper; but this
should never be done with that of the first form; the pressman should
put it into the heap, so that it may be readily found, which keeps
it damp, and the revise of the second form ought always to be pulled
on it; the reader, in revising the second form, then sees the sheet
perfect, which is necessary to ascertain that the matter follows, and
that the furniture is right.


RIBS.

In wooden presses, long pieces of steel, polished on the upper
surface, which is a little rounded, on which the carriage traverses
in being run in and run out; they are fastened down upon long pieces
of wood, which are called Wooden Ribs.


RIDES.

Leads are said to ride, when one end projects over another; this
will occasionally take place when two or more are used in the same
measure. It ought to be guarded against, as, when it happens, it
prevents the page rising, or if by tightening the quoins the form is
made to rise, it causes the lines to be crooked.


RINSE THE FORM.

Laying up the form, and washing the lye and ink away to make the
letter clean.--_M._ This is always done by the pressman as soon as a
form is off; he takes it to the lye trough, and brushes the ink from
off the face of the letter, the furniture, and chase, with the lye
brush and lye; he then lifts it out of the trough and sets it on its
edge, resting against the side of the trough or against some other
support, and rinses it well with water, to wash away the lye and the
ink it has dissolved, and thus leaves the face of the letter, the
furniture, and the chase clean, ready for the compositor to lay up
preparatory to distributing.--_See_ LAY UP.


RINSING TROUGH.

The trough forms are rinsed in.--_M._ It is two troughs combined in
one; the smallest and deepest is for the water, and in some offices
has an iron ladle chained to the near upper corner, to prevent its
being displaced; the shallow part is used to lay up forms in; they
are both lined with lead, and the shallow one has a loose deal bottom
to preserve the lead, and in general is bound with iron, particularly
at the front, to prevent the edge of a chase, when being lifted upon
the letter board, from cutting the lead; they both have an opening
with a short pipe at the bottom to convey away the water; that in
the water trough having a brass plug in it, for the convenience of
letting the water off to clean it out. They stand on a frame, which
is usually placed in a platform raised at the edges a few inches,
lined with lead, styled the sink, with a loose bottom of boards,
which leads into a pipe for drainage.

[Illustration: A wooden rinsing trough]


RISE.

A form is said to rise, when in rearing it off the correcting stone
no letter or furniture, &c. stay behind.--_M._ When every thing is
properly justified, and the form properly quoined and locked up, so
that nothing falls out in lifting it up.


RISERS.

The material upon which stereotype plates are fixed, in order to be
printed.

These risers are sometimes made of wood, with the plates screwed, or
otherwise fastened upon them; sometimes of brass, bell metal, gun
metal, or type metal; and occasionally of gypsum, or Roman cement:
but, of whatever substance they may be formed, the riser and the
plate together should be of the same height as types.

Mr. James Fergusson took out a patent for risers made of elastic
substances, of which he published the following description, or
specification:--“Now know ye, that I the said James Fergusson,
in compliance with the said Proviso, do hereby declare, that the
nature of my said Invention, and the manner in which the same is
to be performed, are particularly described and ascertained by
the following explanation thereof, that is to say: In the process
of printing from Stereotype Plates, the plates are put upon, and
fastened to, certain materials or apparatus, called by different
names, such as blocks, matrix-plates, risers, &c., which are made
either of iron, brass, type-metal, bell-metal, Roman cement, gypsum,
wood of various kinds, or some other suitable substance; or, without
using any such materials or apparatus, the plates are, or may be,
put upon, and fastened to, the coffins or tables of such printing
presses as are in general use, or upon cylindrical or any other
sort of printing machines. In all cases, however, of printing from
Stereotype Plates, it is necessary to apply some remedy to the
unequal thickness of the plates; and the operation usually adopted is
that of putting layers or pieces of paper, or other material, under
the thinner places of the plates, or over the same, upon the tympan,
which operation is technically termed _underlaying_ and _overlaying_.
Now, the nature or object of my Invention is that of saving the
time and expence unavoidably sacrificed in the operation of
underlaying and overlaying; and this object I accomplish by putting
elastic substances under the Stereotype Plates, whereby the printed
impressions from them are immediately equalized wholly or in part;
for the elastic substances yield to the pressure upon the thicker
parts of the plates, and at the same time afford the necessary
resistance for obtaining sufficient strength of impressions from the
thinner parts. It must be evident, that the elastic substances are
to be interposed between the Stereotype Plates and whatever solid or
firm substance may be made use of, whether blocks, matrix-plates,
risers, cylinders, printing presses, printing machines, or any other
apparatus whatsoever. So far as I have made experiments and trials
of different elastic substances, I have hitherto found Cork to be
the best calculated for the purposes of my Invention; but, in virtue
of the Letters Patent granted unto me, I claim the exclusive right
and privilege of applying Cork, and any other elastic substance,
to all kinds of printing apparatus and machines, with the view of
remedying the inequalities in the thickness of Stereotype Plates;
and I also claim the sole right and privilege of manufacturing the
elastic articles requisite for the attainment of this object, of
vending such articles, and of granting Licenses for the use of the
same. In further explanation of the manner in which my Invention is
to be performed, it may be proper to state, that the Cork is prepared
by cutting, sawing, rasping, and filing; and by these means it is
wrought to such a uniform thickness as is required. I consider a
quarter of an inch as a proper thickness, but a lesser or a greater
may be adopted. If, when a determinate thickness has been fixed
upon, the Cork is to be applied to some apparatus now in use, that
apparatus should of course be diminished as much as is the thickness
of the Cork, in order that the same height to paper may be preserved.
The layers or beds of Cork may be formed either of single pieces,
cut to the respective sizes of pages, or made up by several slips,
whereby they may be adjusted to various widths and lengths. Whether
the Cork be laid loose upon the blocks, &c., or be attached by soft
pitch, shoemakers’ wax, or other adhesive substance, is unimportant;
but I prefer attaching it, so as to keep it in its place. Although
my Invention essentially consists in discovering the applicability
of Elastic Substances for the purpose of remedying inequalities in
the thickness of Stereotype Plates, yet, in this Specification, I
have necessarily given my explanations by particularising Cork,
that being the material which I now manufacture and prefer. How to
adapt any other elastic substance, which may answer the purpose
equally well as Cork, cannot be a matter of doubt or difficulty to
any person practically acquainted with apparatus used in Stereotype
Press-work.----In witness whereof, &c.”

Mr. T. C. Hansard took out a patent for improvements on, and
additions to, Printing Presses, and various processes relative to
Printing; these improvements included “Stereotype-Plate Risers, with
Holdfasts or Claws,” of which Mr. Hansard published the following
description:--“The Risers are made of Type Metal, or with any other
metal or substance, cast in a Type-founder’s mould, having somewhat
the form of what are called Quotations. I take the usual standard
for Printer’s ad-measurement, and cast them quadrilateral to four
Pica m’s; then longer ones as parallelograms, four by eight, four
by twelve, four by sixteen, and smaller ones, four by two, four by
one, and four by a half; in height they are about three-fourths
of an inch, or sufficient to raise the Plate to the usual height,
or somewhat higher than common Type; these being cast and dressed
perfectly true, in body and height, may be easily combined to form
the size of any page necessary, with the certainty of having a
uniform plain surface for all the plates, however numerous; they are
cast as hollow cubes, the larger combinations having divisions to
give sufficient support to every square against any pressure which
can be brought upon them.

“The Holdfasts or Claws are formed of Brass or other hard metal,
accurately adjusted in thickness to a Brevier, or any other body
chosen, with a projecting Bevil at the top. They may be of various
lengths, as to 4, 8, 16, 24, or more or less, Pica m’s, the elongated
parts of the larger ones being to the height of ordinary Reglet,
having the Holdfast or Claw in the centre, or towards each end. They
may be opened, or pierced, as well to make them lighter, as to cause
them, by pressing and indenting into the furniture of the forme,
to be less liable to be drawn out: the height of the Claw is about
seven-eighths of an inch, or sufficient for the projecting bevil of
about one-eighth of an inch to lay upon the flanch of the plate when
resting on the Risers. To prepare plates for working, form with the
Risers the requisite number of pages for the forme or sheet to the
nearest size they may make by the various combinations, and add any
difference wanting by reglet, leads, or scale-board; then lay on the
Plates, and place at the head, foot, and sides of each plate as many
Holdfasts as may, from the size of the plate, be deemed sufficient
for proper fastening; thus for small pages, as in Octadecimos and
Duodecimos, one at each side and end will be sufficient; for larger
pages two or more may be thought necessary; making up the parts which
they may be deficient of the length and breadth of the pages with
quadrats or reglet of the same body; then proceed to make margin,
or dress the formes, and lock-up in the usual mode. To change the
Plates; when worked, unlock the forme, draw out the Holdfast at the
head or foot of the plate, slide off the done-with plate, replace
by the new one; lock up again; and if the Plates have all been cast
true to one gauge in thickness, width, and length, you will have
throughout the whole work exact and uniform register, and equal
impression;--when the Work is completed, the same material of Risers
and Holdfasts, by admitting every combination of size, will form into
any other sized pages for any other sized plates.”

ROLL UP BALL LEATHERS.

When the pressman leaves work at noon he draws half the nails out of
the balls, and takes the wool out; then doubles the loose half of the
leather over the remaining nailed-on half, with the inky sides of
each half next each other, and rolls up the leathers close, and lays
them in a bowl or pan of water to soak till he has dined--_M_. This
plan is entirely discontinued; the ball nails now are never drawn nor
the covering taken off till it is worn out, owing to the different
composition of the ink.


ROLLER.

A cylinder coated with composition, fixed in an iron frame, and
revolving upon an iron rod running through it, with which to ink the
forms, preparatory to taking an impression.

[Illustration: A two-handled roller.]

The roller has almost entirely superseded the use of balls in
printing; and, since the introduction of composition, I may venture
to say it has completely superseded the use of pelts for balls. _See_
PELTS.

The use of the roller is less laborious to the pressman than balls;
and for common work, and indeed all work where weak ink is used,
it coats the surface of the types, &c. more uniformly, perhaps,
than balls; but for fine work, where strong ink must be used, and
really fine work cannot be produced without strong ink, the roller
is decidedly inferior to the ball, partly owing to the difficulty of
taking ink and distributing it on the inking table; and partly owing
to the inferiority of rolling to beating with balls, in coating the
surface of the types with strong ink.

The introduction of composition in lieu of pelts has been the cause
of a complete change in printing; but for this article, machine or
cylindrical printing would never have been accomplished, as all the
first attempts were made with skins to coat the roller, and all
failed, owing to the imperfection of joining the edges; it was this
that baffled Nicholson, who died before its introduction; and it was
the introduction of this article that enabled König to avail himself
of Nicholson’s invention and to reduce it to practice, after he had
failed in his project of applying steam to the working of presses.

The composition was first introduced in printing by Mr. B. Foster,
who spread it in a melted state on canvass, and then formed it into
balls in the usual manner. I have been informed that Mr. Foster
obtained his knowledge of its properties from a cotton manufactory,
where it was used in some part of the machinery; but Mr. T. C.
Hansard says that it was in the Staffordshire potteries, in which
they use what are there called dabbers, that Mr. Foster first
observed it.

_Composition._--Mr. Hansard, a printer of extensive practice, in his
Typographia, says, “The composition consists principally of glue and
molasses, or treacle. I have seen various receipts of ingredients and
proportions, some possessing the recommendations which distinguish
the recipes of ancient physicians; namely, a vast variety of articles
with counteracting properties. But the simple prescription which my
experience has proved best, is, to provide _glue_ of the finest
quality, made from the cuttings of parchment or vellum; fine green
_molasses_, pure from the sugar refiner, at least not adulterated for
the bakers’ or grocers’ shops; and a small quantity of the substance
called Paris-white [carbonate of barytes], and you will have every
ingredient requisite for the compo. The proportions have been so
variously stated, and so different from what I have found to be
eligible, that I am wholly at a loss to account for such differences.

                                                         Pounds of
                                                      Glue.  Molasses.
  One receipt which now lies before me _in print_, says  2   1
  Another, MS.                                           2   3
  I find a mixture of                                    2   6 or 2   7

and about half a pound of the Paris-white, will make the compo of a
superior quality to any other proportions, and will be sufficient for
two demy rollers. The great disparity which appears in these receipts
may perhaps be attributed to a difference in the quality of the
materials, and to the mode of management.” Thus far Mr. Hansard on
the component parts of the composition.

The late Mr. Robert Branston, an eminent engraver on wood, and who
was also very skilful in printing his productions in a superior
manner, told me that he made his balls of glue, treacle, and a little
shoemakers wax, and that they answered as well as Foster’s. The Cave
of Despair, in my Practical Hints on Decorative Printing, will serve
as a specimen of his abilities in both these departments.

An ingenious printer in the country, and a good workman, sent me
the following receipt, from which he used to make balls for his own
use:--Take a pound and a half of glue, let it soak in cold water
twelve hours, boil it without any additional water; when it is hot
add half a pound of treacle, half an ounce of turpentine, and a
quarter of a pound of tar; this quantity is sufficient for a pair of
balls. Prepare your canvass or coarse cloth of the size the balls are
wanted, by rubbing on it bees wax, (or common paste will answer the
purpose after it has been allowed to dry,) to prevent the composition
running through the pores; when the mixture is nearly cold, pour it
on the canvass, held in a concave manner, in order that it may be the
thickest in the middle, and thinner at the edges; then knock up the
balls in the usual way.

Another receipt, from which a large establishment in London made
their balls and rollers, and the latter both for their machines and
presses, is equal parts of glue and treacle; but as the composition
is affected by the state of the atmosphere, it is found by experience
that in cold weather a greater proportion of treacle is required, and
in warm weather a greater proportion of glue.

This establishment was of opinion that the glue known by the name of
London Glue is the strongest and best.

These different receipts, each of which was held in high estimation
by the party who made use of it on account of its individual
superiority over others, tend to show that different proportions
of the same materials with different ingredients incorporated with
the mixture, produce a composition that possesses all the requisite
qualities.

_Casting Rollers._--Mr. Hansard gives the following directions:--“The
cylinder upon which the compo is cast is made of alder-wood, turned
to a requisite diameter, so that the coat of compo which it receives
is half an inch. The cylinder is perforated through its centre,
having a brass bush or collar driven into each end, through which is
passed an iron rod, as an axis, with an enlarged head at one end, and
tapped with a screw at the other.

“It is necessary to procure a mould very accurately made and well
finished. Mine is made of brass, in two parts, adjusted to each
other with rebates, the inside being finely turned and polished, and
having flanches projecting by which the parts are screwed together
by the screw and lock-burr. To each end is also fitted a collar; and
a circular plate of iron is accommodated with great precision to
the bore of the mould, having a projection in its centre to enter
a cylinder of wood about which the compo is to attach itself, and
to hold it exactly in the centre of the mould, and the other end of
which is kept in a corresponding position by means of a brass piece
to allow of the compo passing down between the interior surface of
the mould and the wooden cylinder. There are little projections on
the sides of the mould, which serve as feet to support each half in
a steady position while lying upon a table or elsewhere. Previous to
joining, the parts of the mould must be nicely cleaned and oiled, and
the greatest care taken that no particle of compo, grit, or dirt,
remain in the rebate. The parts being carefully placed on each other,
and the wooden cylinder fixed inside, the screws must be put into
their respective places in the flanches, and when all is properly
made tight the mould is to be set upright for receiving the compo.

“The next material part of the apparatus is the melting kettle.
This must be a double vessel like a glue-kettle, so that the compo
in the interior may be melted by the heat of the boiling water in
the exterior. For this purpose a strong boiler may be the best or
readiest thing found, into which let a tin vessel be fitted, with a
flanch to rest on the rim, so as to leave one or two inches clear
under it. This vessel may be six or eight inches above the top of the
boiler, so that the lid of the one may fit the other; and it must
have a handle on each side; also a large lip for pouring out the
compo.

“Being thus prepared, put the glue into a little water for a few
hours to soak. Pour off all the liquid, and put the glue into the
inner vessel, the boiler having in it as much water as it will
contain when the inner vessel is in its place. Put it on the fire,
and boil the water as quick as you please, the heat of which will
soon cause the glue to dissolve, and evaporate part of the water.
When the glue is all melted, add the molasses, and let them be well
incorporated together for at least an hour, receiving heat from the
boiling water, which is an uniform degree that cannot exceed 212°
of Fahrenheit. Then with a very fine sieve, mix the white powder,
frequently stirring the compo. In another hour, or less, it will be
fit to pour off; and when it is, take the inner vessel out of the
boiler, and pour the mixture gently into the mould through the opened
brass keeper. In about an hour, if the weather be dry and favourable
you may take the roller out of the mould; hang it in a cool, dry,
situation, or lay it horizontally in a rack made for the purpose, and
the next day it will be sufficiently hardened for use. As there will
be rather more of the compo at each end of the cylinder than would
work clear of the frame in which it is to revolve, cut off from each
extremity about half an inch, by encircling it with a piece of fine
twine.”

There is a serious practical disadvantage in the mould being formed
of two pieces; that of having a seam or ridge running the whole
length on both sides of the roller. This seam prevents that accurate
distribution of the ink which is essentially necessary, and increases
the probability and danger of producing monks in the impression,
which ought to be avoided as much as possible, as destructive to good
printing.

I have at different times heard complaints of the difficulty of
drawing the roller out of the mould, and of the injury it frequently
receives from the surface being damaged, which spoils it, and makes
it necessary to be recast. This accident occasions disappointment
and loss of time; as cleaning the mould from the composition which
adheres to it when this happens is tedious. I attribute this to the
mould being made too thin, which expands when the hot mixture is
poured into it, and contracts as the mixture cools, thus becoming, by
the contraction, too small for the roller, and binding it so tight as
to prevent its being drawn out with facility, and without great risk
of injury.

I know one house in the Metropolis that makes rollers in the most
perfect manner, and experiences little or no trouble in drawing
them from the mould; and I know a person who had a mould made, with
the same result. These moulds were made out of a solid cylinder of
metal (tin, or type metal is equally good for the purpose, and more
durable), the aperture bored to the size of the required roller,
and carefully polished on the inside, the tube being thick, in some
instances two inches, so that it was not much affected by the heat
of the composition, the expansion being very trifling, and of course
the contraction small in proportion; so that the roller when cold
was not compressed by the mould, or so slightly as not to cause any
inconvenience or damage to it in drawing out. The inside of the mould
should be carefully wiped out before using, so as to be perfectly
free from dust or dirt, and slightly oiled, which causes the roller
to quit it more readily.

_Preservation._--Mr. Hansard says, “To keep the rollers in good
condition for working, a place should be chosen where the air has
free circulation, without being subject to the extreme heat of the
sun in Summer, or the freezing damp air in winter; in short, in as
even a temperature as possible. It will be necessary to keep a stock
of more rollers than are at work; as it is frequently found, when a
roller is _sick_, or greasy, or soft, or you do not know what is its
ailment, that washing it clean, and hanging it to rest for a time,
restores it to as good a state as ever.

“One other circumstance must be noticed, namely, the influence of the
variable temperatures of different situations on this composition.
This I have had particular opportunities of knowing, from having
carried on business in two distant offices. It frequently happened
that when the compo was working kindly at one office, nothing could
be more teazing than its progress at the other. Indeed, while I was
supplied by those who make for the trade, one of my houses frequently
gave them a great deal of trouble. I have heard both Foster and
Harrild say, ‘that they were obliged to make a harder compo on
purpose for my house and one or two others similarly situated, than
the customary temper of the mixture:’ and, frequently, the only
alternative was, to find me a roller that had got hard and useless at
some other house, to suit the low temperature of mine. The difference
was this--one of my houses had the press-room on the ground-floor,
the joists and flooring lying on the earth; the sink room adjoining;
wet sheets hanging very low; very little influence from the sun,
and no thorough ventilation; consequently, from the humidity of the
atmosphere engendered by these circumstances, it was a constant
complaint that the compo was too soft. At my other house the
press-room was on the two-pair floor; the poles very high; the sun’s
rays had free admittance, and the ventilation was very complete.
Here the compo, complained of as too soft at the former house, was
all that could be wished: hence it became the roller-nursery; and by
sending them to hang up a day or two, when out of order at the other
place, they became firm and fit for work.”

From this statement it appears that any fixed proportions of the
materials for the composition cannot answer generally, and that they
must vary according to circumstances. And it may cause us to cease
wondering at the number of recipes, and of the different proportions
of the various articles, and at being told that they all answered
very well; for it is evidently owing to the situation, whether moist
or dry, of the press-room of a printing office, that different
proportions of ingredients are requisite to make a roller work well,
under different circumstances.

The usual method of keeping rollers in working condition is to cover
them at night, and when they are not likely to be wanted for some
time, with a coating of common or refuse ink; this does not dry, and
prevents evaporation, and thus keeps them in working condition: the
ink must be scraped off when they are required for use. A roller will
get foul in the course of working, or become too hard, it should
then be washed well with lye and the lye brush, which will remove
the foulness, and it may be further washed with clean water and the
hand to remove the lye, and to give it a clean surface; it would
then be necessary to distribute it well on a clean table. It would
be now advisable to proceed with the presswork with a fresh roller,
and allow the one that was washed to have a rest, which generally
improves its working condition. If a roller become too hard, and the
surface is clean, then washing it with clean water and the hand,
distributing it on a clean table, and placing it in a damp situation,
will restore it; in fact, when the press-room is dry and well
ventilated, keeping the rollers in a damp situation when not in use
is preferable, in my opinion, to softening them with water, as the
moisture is gradually imbibed by the composition, and makes it more
uniformly soft and kind.

When rollers get too soft, the general practice is to hang them up
in a current of cool dry air, which evaporates the superabundant
moisture, cools the composition if the room has been too warm, and
brings them to a good working state. But a more expeditious and
effective method, is to sponge them with spirit of turpentine, which
restores them to a proper condition sooner than any other method, and
also cleans them more effectually than lye. If the same rollers are
required to be used when it is necessary to change the colour of the
ink, there is not any article that will clean them so expeditiously,
and take the ink which had been used out of them so completely, as
spirit of turpentine.

Occasionally the pressman finds that he cannot produce good and clear
impressions with all the care and attention that he can bestow upon
his work, and this when his roller seems to be in good condition, and
no apparent cause can be assigned for the deficiency of quality; the
roller is then said to be _sick_, or _tired_; and the only remedy
that has yet answered to remove this inconvenience is to _give the
roller rest_; that is, to hang it up, and take another roller for the
work in hand; after resting for some time, it will be found that the
sick or tired roller has resumed its original qualities, and will
again produce good work.

Rollers, when not in use, should always be hung up in a shady place,
which is generally done by one end of the frame, for if left on the
inking table they would stick to it, and the composition would be
torn in the act of separation; neither should they be exposed to
the action of the rays of the sun in summer, which will soften the
composition so much as to cause it to run, and thus spoil the roller.
These observations apply equally to composition balls.

The following is an abstract of the French method of making and
treating rollers.

The French roller-makers proportions are eight pounds of glue and
twelve pounds of treacle, which is sufficient for four rollers used
at press; the quantity required for those used at machines will vary
according to their length and diameter.

Paris made glue is the best: it ought to be transparent, have little
colour, and break like glass. Flexibility in glue is a proof of its
weakness; and it is injured by being left in a damp place.

The treacle ought to be pure; the most compact is the best. To avoid
being deceived, it is best to buy the refined. The old is weak, and
not of a good quality for rollers.

In preparing to make four rollers, two pounds of good glue must be
soaked in river water; the strength of the glue must determine how
long; but if too long the glue loses its strength, and the rollers
are injured.

This portion of the glue, thus soaked, is then put into the melting
kettle, and placed over a fire, and stirred with a spatula; and
when it is quite melted, the rest of the glue is added in similar
portions, till the whole eight pounds are melted, which ought to have
an hour’s boiling before adding the twelve pounds of treacle. The
treacle is then gently poured into the melted glue, stirring them
until they are well incorporated. This done, they are left over a
moderate fire for an hour, stirring them with a spatula every ten
minutes. The surface must be skimmed, and afterwards the vessel must
be left a little time to slightly cool, before being poured into the
mould.

The cylindrical tube in which the rollers are cast should be smeared
in the inside with a brush with oil; neatsfoot oil is the best; and
it is necessary that every part should be carefully oiled, and that
the wooden cylinder should be well cleaned and free from moisture.

These observations can only apply generally to the making of
rollers; it is practice which can alone furnish the particulars. The
temperature varying in each season must be the object of special
attention, as it renders the materials more or less flexible, and
requires the composition to be more or less boiled.

It is a fault with rollers when they lug too much, as it detaches
the composition from the wooden cylinder. When they are moist they
should not be too much washed, as that also tends to make them lug,
and detaches the composition. If they are used too soon after making,
they distribute the ink badly, fill up the letters, and last but a
very little time. They ought to be exposed to a current of air to
dry them, and to be carefully scraped before being used, and again
afterwards. If they are too dry they must be sponged all over and
distributed upon the table until the water has disappeared, and then
on a clean table, before taking ink. When they begin to grow old and
hard by work, they must be washed in proper lye without being rinsed
in water, and care and attention given to their wiping; and by these
means they may be preserved for a considerable time. Rollers, when
not in use, should be suspended in a place neither too dry nor too
damp.

_Recasting._--Before recasting old rollers, take great care to wash
them well with lye, in order to detach the ink with which they are
coated: if they are dry they must be scraped with a knife, as grease
deteriorates the matter. Afterwards cut the composition all over with
a knife, and it will then be easily detached from the wood. If it is
new it will not need cutting, it will easily dissolve; if old it must
be cut into little pieces, that it may dissolve more easily, and with
less loss: if the composition is very strong, the little pieces must
be washed in a pail of water, warm water is better than cold; add to
it two pounds of treacle, for four rollers, and so in proportion:
when the matter draws out well in threads, the composition is good.

If the rollers have been recast many times, and they draw too much,
they may be recast without adding fresh treacle or glue. Rollers
which are recast are better than new; they are more elastic and less
melting. With three pounds of glue, five pounds of treacle, and the
matter of three old rollers, four rollers can be made; if a small
glass of spirits of wine be added it will facilitate the dissolving.

The rollers fail the most frequently at the ends. They ought to be
dry, and clear from grease. It is a good plan before using them to
scrape them clean, and to sponge the ends for about an inch and a
half with spirits of wine, and to leave them to dry; the gelatine
draws better.


ROSE ENGINE.

The rose engine is, I believe, a French invention, and has long been
used for turning ornaments on metal, for instance, watch cases and
other articles of plate; it was afterwards applied to produce them to
print from by the rolling press: during the sitting of the commission
for inquiring into the best means for preventing the forgery of bank
notes, about twenty years ago, Mr. Perkins introduced a specimen
bank note which was partly executed by this machine; and the late
Mr. Branston, then of the firm of Whiting and Branston, was, if I
am not mistaken, the first to engrave by its means for letterpress
printing, and the tickets and shares for the last state lottery were
executed by it at Beaufort House. Its great value for the prevention
of forgery is, that all circles, curved and angular lines produced by
this machine are precisely similar to each other and true, however
numerous, and however small or large; it would be next to impossible
to produce the same designs, with the same accuracy, by the hand, and
the operation would also be uncommonly tedious.

By the kindness of Mr. Holtzapffel I am enabled to introduce into
this work a number of different patterns; only one specimen of
each individual apparatus is given. The patterns which are capable
of being produced are almost endless, and depend on the skill and
taste of the operator; the variations in the designs being caused by
different chucks being used in the operation; and the combinations
of the effect produced by each chuck, either in straight lines,
circles, ellipses, or as a ground covering the whole surface, in
many instances are very delicate and have a beautiful effect. The
following enumeration shows how the annexed specimens were produced.

Figs. 1. 10. Holtzapffel and Co.’s compound oval and eccentric
chuck:--1. Two eccentric movements; 10. One oval and one eccentric
movement. 2. 6. 8. Ibbetson’s geometric chuck, parts first, second
and third. 3. Rose engine. 4. Straight line chuck. 5. Segment engine.
7. Oval chuck. 9. Eccentric chuck. 11. Eccentric chuck with the rose
engine. 12. 15. Holtzapffel and Co.’s compound oval and eccentric
chuck with the rose engine:--12. One oval and one eccentric movement;

Ibbetson’s compound eccentric chuck. 16. Geometric chuck combined

For details and descriptions of the various chucks, with the methods
of operating with them, the reader is referred to Manuel de Tourneur,
published by Bergeron in 1792, and to “Specimens in Eccentric
Turning, with Practical Instructions. By John Holt Ibbetson, Esq.”
Third Edition, 8vo. London. [1840.]

Mr. Ibbetson observes, “The number of beautiful designs which
may be obtained by combining, on this principle, two circular
adjusting movements is inconceivable. Consecutive circles, &c. may
be arranged, not only in elliptical curves, but in the shape of
hearts--in straight lines--in triangles--in squares--in polygons, and
in both inward and outward looped figures.”

ROUNCE.

The handle by means of which the carriage of the press is run in and
out.


RUB OUT INK.

Rubbing the ink out smooth and even on the ink-block with the brayer,
for the purpose of taking small quantities with the balls tolerably
diffused over their face.--_M._ The thinner and more equally it is
rubbed out on the ink-block the better, as it in a great measure
prevents monks and friars in working. In fine works, where strong
ink is used, the pressman who beats should occupy his spare time in
using the brayer, as it not only diffuses the ink more equably on the
block, but causes it to work better.


RUBY.

The name of a type, the next in size larger than Pearl and smaller
than Nonpareil; it is half a Small Pica. Mr. Hansard, in his
“Typographia,” gives the following account of its origin and
name:--“It was, in fact, originally a Nonpareil with short ascenders
and descenders, cast on a smaller body, or sometimes a Pearl, on a
larger, to look open; but now some founders have a distinct specimen
for this size. This name has but very lately been adopted in the
type-founders’ specimens, but some years ago it was found, by the
writer of this, absolutely necessary to give some distinguishing
appellation to this size, as the letter-founders had given him
one-nick Pearls of two bodies, viz. one fount half Small Pica,
another half Long Primer; the mistakes arising from this circumstance
in a house much in the habit of using small type occasioned the
expedient of inventing a new name, and as the neighbouring sizes were
called Pearl and Diamond, it seemed not very inapplicable to take the
name of Ruby.”


RUCK.

In printing at machines, the paper, particularly if it be soft and
not flat, in travelling round the cylinders frequently wrinkles; this
is termed _Rucking_, or the _Paper Rucks_, or the _Paper is Rucked_;
when this takes place, the sheets may be looked on as spoiled when
it is for book work: the best preventative is to press the wet paper
well in a powerful press for an hour or two, with small quantities
between the boards, just before it goes to the machine. I would not
recommend more than five quires in each portion, although I am aware
that a ream is generally put in; but the smaller the quantity between
each two boards the flatter the paper will be, and less likely to
ruck.

cases, the open air.

22. Jobs to be cleared away immediately after notice having been
given by the Overseer.

23. These regulations, in cases of extreme hurry of business, by
leave from the Master or Overseer, may be suspended; but, when that
has ceased, to be immediately resumed.

proof.

3. Not to work without a figure unless particularly ordered.

4. As soon as a form is wrought off, the pressman to carry it to the

Compositor’s frame it belongs to.

5. Not to leave the lye jar uncovered.

These rules may be varied to suit the business of the office in which
they may be adopted, or the size of the establishment; in practice
it will be found essentially necessary to have established rules and
regulations, that the business may be carried on with method and good
order.


RULES. _See_ BRASS RULE. METAL RULES.


RUN IN THE CARRIAGE.

Running the form under the platen, by turning the rounce.--_M._ This
corroborates my opinion that the coffin, plank, &c., and not the long
ribs, constitute the carriage, and that it was so understood in the
seventeenth century. _See_ CARRIAGE.


RUN OUT.

The running of the carriage from under the platen, by turning the
rounce.


RUN OUT FROM COPY.--_M._ _See_ DRIVE OUT. This term is not now used.


RUNIC.

“Authors are much divided, as to the antiquity of the Runic
characters; some suppose them to be very ancient, whilst others
contend, that they are more modern than the ancient Gothic. Several
writers affirm, that they were brought from Asia by the celebrated
Woden. Olaus Wormius and Rudbeck contend, that they are older than
the Greek. Mr. Wise says, that the Runic letters are found on coins,
and on stone monuments, some of which may be near two thousand years
old. He also supposes this alphabet to have been exceedingly ancient,
and that it was formed from some alphabet of the Greeks, whilst it
consisted of sixteen letters only, and before they had left the
Eastern way of writing, from the right hand.

“The judicious Celsius was of opinion, that the Runic letters were
nothing more than Roman letters, with the curves changed into
straight lines, for the ease of engraving on hard substances. The
learned and ingenious author of the History of the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire says, that the oldest _Runic_ inscriptions are
supposed to be of the third century; and he adds, that the most
ancient writer, who mentions the Runic characters, is Venantius
Fortunatus, who lived towards the end of the sixth century. Our
opinion on the evidence before us, is, that the report of Woden
having brought the _Runic_ letters from Asia is entirely fabulous;
that the tales of Rudbeck and Olaus Wormius, do not deserve the least
attention; that Mr. Wise, though a respectable writer, is mistaken
as to the antiquity of the Runic letters; that the opinion of the
learned Celsius is nearly true, and that the Runic characters are
composed partly of ancient Gothic and Greek letters, and partly of
Roman, deformed and corrupted, probably by the Necromancers of the
north, who used them in their spells and incantations, to which
they were greatly addicted. The forms of several Runic letters,
compared with the Greek and Gothic alphabets, sufficiently prove this
observation. For instance, the Runic F or Fei, is a rude imitation
of the Roman F, with the same vocal powers. The O or Oys, is an
inverted digamma, with the power of the Roman U, that is of _ou_ or
_W_. R or Ridhur, is evidently the Roman R, with the same powers. I
or Iis, is the Gothic and Roman I. S or Sol, is a resemblance of the
ancient Greek Σ, with the same power. T or Tyr is an imitation of the
Greek Tau, or Roman T. B or Biarkan is the Greek Beta, or Roman B;
and L or Lagur appears to have been taken from the Grecian Lambda. We
are of opinion, that the resemblances above pointed out, sufficiently
evince, that the Runic characters are derived from the Greek, Gothic,
and Roman letters.

“In the year 1001, the Swedes were persuaded by the Pope to lay aside
the Runic letters, and to adopt the Roman in their room. In the year
1115, the Runic letters were condemned in Spain, by the council
of Toledo. They were abolished in Denmark in the beginning of the
fourteenth century, and in Iceland soon after.

“The order of the old Runic alphabet, which consisted of sixteen
letters, was as follows: F, U, D, O, R, K, H, N, I, A, S, T, B, L,
M, YR. It is not known when the order of the Runic alphabet was
confounded, but we do not suppose that it is of greater antiquity
upon that account.”--_Astle._

Milman has the following remarks on the opinion of Gibbon quoted
above by Mr. Astle: “The obscure subject of the Runic characters has
exercised the industry and ingenuity of the modern scholars of the
north. There are three distinct theories; one, maintained by Schlözer
(Nordische Geschichte, p. 481, &c.), considers their sixteen letters
to be a corruption of the Roman alphabet, post-Christian in their
date, and Schlözer would attribute their introduction into the north
to the Alemanni. The second, that of Frederick Schlegel (Vorlesungen
über alte und neue Literatur), supposes that these characters were
left on the coasts of the Mediterranean and Northern Seas by the
Phœnicians, preserved by the priestly castes, and employed for
purposes of magic. Their common origin from the Phœnician would
account for their similarity to the Roman letters. The last, to which
we incline, claims a much higher and more venerable antiquity for
the Runic, and supposes them to have been the original characters of
the Indo-Teutonic tribes, brought from the East, and preserved among
the different races of that stock. See Über Deutsche Runen, von W.
C. Grimm, 1821. A Memoir by Dr. Legis. Fundgruben des alten Nordens.
Foreign Quarterly Review, vol. ix. p. 438.”--_Gibbon, chap._ ix.

The University of Oxford are in possession of the matrices of a Pica
Runic, which is the only one in England.

  +-----+---------+------------------------------------------------+

Most of the above letters invariably retain their proper sound, the
following however are subject to slight variations.

Г, gā. In some instances bears the sound of a strongly aspirated h:
герои, a hero, _héroy_; генералъ, a general, _héneral_; Господь,
Lord, _Hospod_, and in the terminations of adjectives and pronouns,
in the genitive case, may be pronounced either as v or h, его, yāho
or _yāvo_; что новаго? what news, tchtō nōvahō, or _nōvavō_?

Е, ā. At the commencement of words bears the sound of yā, ex. есть,
it is, _yaste_; едва, scarcely, _yādva_. When it precedes two
consonants, or a consonant followed by the hard sign, ъ, it generally
bears the sound of yeo, as in yeoman, the accent falling upon o,
ex. медъ, honey, _meo͡dd_; ленъ, flax, _leo͡nn_; орелъ, an eagle,
_oreo͡ll_.

ѣ, yā. Is pronounced like yā at the commencement of a word, and like
ā in the middle or at the end, ex. ѣхать, to ride, _yachat_; лѣнорть,
idleness, _lānoste_; на столъ, on the table, _na stollāy_.

There are eleven vowels in the Russian alphabet, which are divided
into hard and soft.

  Hard а, о, у, э, ы.                    Soft я, е, ю, и, ѣ.

  In the combination of vowels with consonants, they are subject to the
  following variations:

  The letter ы following г, к, х, ж, ч, ш, or щ changes into u
       --    я     --  г, к, х, ж, ч, ш, щ, or ц      --     a
       --    ю     --  г, к, х, ж, ч, ш, щ, or ц      --     y
       --    о     --           ж, ч, ш, щ, or ц      --     e
       --    е     --  г, к, or х                     --     o
       --    и before another vowel                   --     i

The only diphthongs in the Russian language are those formed by the
combination of и with the other vowels: ай, ей, ій, ой, ый, яй. When
и occurs without the ̆ it must be pronounced separately from the
vowel, which precedes it, ex. воиин, a warrior, _vo-een_. Whenever
two vowels occur together in a word (excepting the above-mentioned
diphthongs) each bears its full and separate sound, ex. воображеніе,
imagination, _vō-ob-ra-jā-nē-ā_--_A Practical Grammar of the Russian
Language, by James Heard._ _2 Parts, 12mo._ _St. Petersburg_, 1827.


RUTHVEN’S PRESS.

Ruthven’s patent press differs materially from all others. Instead of
the form of types being rolled under the platen, and back again when
the impression has been made, the type form remains stationary upon
the iron table, the platen is drawn over it, and the impression is
obtained by means of a lever working vertically like the handle of a
pump, and acting by connecting levers upon both sides of the platen,
so as to draw it down with ease and effect. It is a good and powerful
press, but the head and platen are heavy and require exertion to push
them back off the form, and more particularly as the ribs, if the
grooves in which the wheels attached to the head and platen travel
may be so called, form an inclined plane, which causes the platen to
come forward over the form with but little exertion.

SAMARITAN.

It is the opinion of many of the most eminent Hebrew scholars, that
this alphabet is the one made use of by the ancient Hebrews, and with
which Moses himself wrote the Pentateuch; and that the Hebrew letters
at present in use are those of the Chaldees of Babylon, introduced by
Ezra in consequence of the Jews having forgotten their own characters
during the Captivity. It agrees with the Hebrew and Syriac, in
respect to the number and power of the letters, though it differs as
to their forms, as may be seen from the annexed table:

It will be readily perceived that this is one of the most simple of
the Oriental alphabets, as there are no initials or medials, as is
the case with the Arabic and Syriac; there are no letters lengthened
for the sake of ornament, as in the Hebrew and Chaldee; and there are
no finals.

With respect to pronunciation, ࠀ‎ ࠇ‎ and ࠏ‎ seem to differ
very little from each other, if we may judge from their frequent
permutation.

In writing the numbers, they follow the Hebrew system of notation,
with this exception, that for 15 they use both ࠄࠉ‎ (10 and 5) with
the Syrians, and ࠅࠈ‎ (9 and 6) with the Jews.

The Samaritans are altogether destitute of vowel points, and their
power is to be collected from the cognate languages.

The quiescents are the same in Samaritan as in Hebrew and Chaldee,
namely, four, ࠀ‎, ࠄ‎, ࠅ‎, ࠉ‎. The situations and the points, by
which each becomes quiescent, are the same as in Hebrew.

The Samaritans use also certain points and lines in writing, partly
for the sake of distinction, and partly of abbreviation. The points
are as follow:--

  1. A thick point placed near the top of the letter distinguishes
  one word from another, thus ࠰ࠄࠄࠋࠀ ࠰ࠓࠌࠀࠅ‎ _and God said_.

  2. An imperfect sentence is indicated by two transverse points,
  in this manner, ࠰࠰ࠌࠉࠌࠋ‎ _saying_--

  3. A period or perfect sentence is marked by two perpendicular
  points, thus, ࠱ࠄࠌࠅࠄࠕ ࠰ࠉࠐࠀ ࠰ࠋࠏ‎ _upon the face of the deep_.

  4. The beginning of every verse is marked by an asterisk, as,
  ‎‮-¦-‬ࠅࠀࠌࠓ࠰ࠀࠋࠄ࠰‎ _And God said_.

  5. In long paragraphs a third point is added to the period, thus,
   ‮¦-‬‎, and in order to point off sections various lines are made
  use of,as ‮:>-‬‎, ‮¦-—‬‎, in which much is left to fancy.

A line drawn above a letter denotes:--

  1. That words with two meanings must not be received in their
  more general signification, as, ࠓࠓࠓ̅ࠓ‎ bedebher, _in pestilence_,
  not ࠓࠓࠓࠓ‎ bedabhar, _in a word_;  ࠌࠔ̅‎ _Sem_, for a proper name,
  not an appellative;  ࠋࠀ̅‎ _El_, for the name of God, and not the
  preposition.

  2. Apocope, or elision of a letter, as, ࠕ̅ࠀ‎ for ࠄࠕࠀ‎‎ atta,
  _thou_; ࠏ̅ࠔࠉࠅ‎ for ࠄࠏࠔࠉࠅ‎ _and he looked back_.

  3. The mark of a quiescent letter, as, ࠉࠅ̅ࠔ‎ _he placed_.

  4. The substitution of one letter for another, as, ࠕ̅ࠌࠔ‎ for
  ‎ࠔࠌࠄ‎ _his name_.

The preceding observations are abridged from the “Synopsis
Institutionum Samaritanarum” of George Otho, printed at
Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1707.

SANSKRITA. The term _Sanskṛita_ seems to have been given to the
language so called by way of pre-eminence, and to distinguish it from
the vulgar dialects called _Prākṛita_. The former is an epithet
implying elegance and perfection, and the latter the contrary.

Several of the provinces of India have alphabets distinct from each
other, in which they not only write their particular dialects, but
even _Sanskṛita_. Indeed most of the alphabets, properly Indian,
agree in the number, order, and power of their letters, with the
_Dēva-nāgari_, the one here used, because it is that in which
_Sanskṛita_ is most commonly written, and which is the most elegant
and approved.

All languages of the Hindu class are read from left to right.

In speaking of the letters individually, it is the practice to use
the term कार: _kārah_ (make, form) after each of their names as here
exhibited: thus the vowel अ _a_, is called अकार: _a-kārah_; and the
consonant क _ka_, ककार: _ka-kārah_.

OF THE VOWELS.

The simple vowels are reckoned five; for which there are ten
characters: अ _a_, इ _i_, उ _u_, ऋ _ṛi_, ऌ _ḷri_, to denote the
short sounds; and आ _ā_, ई _ī_, ऊ _ū_, ॠ _ṛī_, ॡ _ḷrī_ their
corresponding long sounds, which are directed to be held twice the
time of the short.

Most of the vowels, occasionally, assume a very different shape from
that exhibited in the alphabet, which the following arrangement may
serve to explain.

_As Initials._

अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ ॠ ऌ ॡ ए ऐ ओ औ

_As Medials and Finals._

ऻ ि ी ु ू ृ ॄ ॖ ॗ े ै ो ौ

_Initials, Medials, and Finals, in composition with a Consonant._

अक _aka_, आका _ākā_, इकि _iki_, ईकी _īkī_, उकु _uku_, ऊकू _ūkū_, ऋकृ
_ṛikṛi_, ॠकॄ _ṛīkṛī_,

ऌकॢ _ḷrikḷri_, ॡकॣ _ḷrīkḷrī_, एके _ēkē_, ऐकै _aikai_, ओको _ōkō_,
औकौ_aukau_.

In this manner the vowels may be combined with any other consonant.

As the letters have the same powers in composition which are given to
them in the alphabet, and do not, as in our language, change their
sound with their situation, a few observations on the pronunciation
of each character in due order, may enable a person to read with
tolerable accuracy and ease.

अ _a_, the first letter in the alphabet, has that obscure short sound
which the French give to _e_, in the particle _le_, and which is
very common in our language, though there be no distinct character
for it; as in the words _money_, _honey_, and some others, where it
is represented by _o_; and in _but_, _shut_, and the like, where _u_
is the substitute. The letter अ never makes its appearance but as an
initial; for when the sound of it is required after a consonant, as
a medial or final, it is pronounced with it as in the alphabet; it
being an invariable rule, that every open consonant, not followed by
another vowel, must be pronounced as if अ _a_ were written after it.

आ _ā_ should have the same sound as is given to the former, held
twice the length. It occurs, as a medial, in the word काला _kāla_,
Time, the first syllable of which is pronounced nearly like the
English word _call_. As a medial and final its character is [#].

इ _i_, and ई _ī_, are two characters to note the sound which the
Italians give to the vowel _i_. The former is to be pronounced
short, like _ee_ in _meet_ (encounter), and the latter long, like
the same letters in _meet_ (fit). After a consonant, as a medial and
final, as has been already observed, they are changed to ि and ी ,
which are placed as in the words मणि: _manih_, A jewel, and देवी
_dēvī_, A goddess.

उ _u_, and ऊ _ū_, are to be articulated like _oo_ in the English
words _foot_, and _fool_. After a consonant they are usually
subjoined; as in पुत्र: _putrah_, A son, and भू: _bhūh_, The earth;
but occasionally, particularly after र _r_, on the side, thus रु
_ru_, रू _rū_.

ऋ _ṛi_, and ॠ _ṛī_. The first of these sounds short, somewhat
like _ri_ in _rit_; and the second is the same held twice as long.
ॠ _ṛi_ short occurs in ऋत _ṛita_, Right, True. The other is very
rarely used, except it be in the oblique cases of some nouns. In our
characters a dot under the _ṛ_ may serve to distinguish them from
the syllables रि _ri_ and री _rī_. As medials or finals they are
always placed under their consonants, in this form, नृ _nṛi_, नॄ
_nṛī_.

ऌ _ḷri_, and ॡ _ḷrī_. The short power is found in the word कॢप्त
_kḷripta_, which the learned of Bengal soften into _kḷipta_, and
which, probably, is the true pronunciation of it. The long form
seldom, if ever, occurs but in grammars. Here too a dot under the
_ḷ_ will serve as a distinction, when we would explain them.

ए _ē_, though classed among diphthongs, differs not from the simple
sound of _e_ in _where_; and so it is pronounced in [###] _dēvah_, A
god. It is said to be a compound of अ _a_ and इ _i_.

ऐ _ai_ is a diphthong, and is always sounded as the letter _i_ in our
alphabet; but it will be better to represent it by _ai_. There is an
example of it in the word रै: _raih_, Wealth.

ओ _ō_ differs not from our o held long, as in _stone_; though it is
said to be a diphthong composed of अ _a_ and उ _u_.

औ _au_ is decidedly a diphthong, having the power of _ow_ in the word
_how_; which in these letters would be written thus, हौ _hau_.

Here properly end the vowels, for ं _am_, and : _ah_, are,
correctly speaking, rather substitutes for the nasals, and ह _ha_,
when silent, at the end of a syllable. They are called अनुस्वार:
_anuswārah_, and विसर्ग: _visargah_. The one occurs in the pronouns
अहं _aham_, I, and त्वं _twam_, Thou, and the other in स: _sah_, He.


OF THE CONSONANTS.

The first five-and-twenty consonants are distributed into five
classes, in the plural number called वर्गा: _vargāh_; in speaking
of which, they are named after the first letter of each class: the
first class being called कवर्ग: _ka-vargah_, the class of क _ka_;
the second चवर्ग: _cha-vargah_, the class of च _cha_; and so for the
rest. Some grammarians use the first letter of each class combined
with उ, to denote all the letters in each class respectively, as,
कु _ku_, for the first; चु _chu_, for the second; टु _ṭu_, for the
third; तु _tu_, for the fourth; and पु _pu_, for the fifth class.


_The First Class, or Gutturals, क ख ह घ ङ._

क _ka_ has the precise sound of hard _c_, but is better expressed by
_k_, the power of which not being liable to change.

ख _kha_ has the same sound uttered with greater force, as if combined
with the letter ह _ha_. Ignorant transcribers are very apt to
confound it with the letter श _sha_.

ग _ga_ is the hard _g_, as sounded in _gun_.

घ _gha_ is the same aspirated.

ङ _nga_ is equivalent to _ng_ in _king_. Generally speaking, every
other nasal is resolved into this, before any letter of this class;
or, at least, to be pronounced like it. In Dēva-nāgari manuscripts,
it is, when silent, for the most part represented by the single dot
[ं] अनुस्वार: _anuswāra_.

च छ ज छ ञ _The Second Class, or Palatals, च छ ज छ ञ._

च _cha_ has the exact power we express by _ch_, as in _church_.

छ _ch’ha_ is the former aspirated.

ज _ja_ has the power of _g_ soft, as in _Giles_; but will be more
certainly expressed by _j_, as in _James_.

छ _jha_ is the aspirate of the former.

ञ _ṇa_. This is the proper nasal of this class, which in composition
is sounded rather softer than ङ _nga_, It seems to be formed by
pressing the whole breadth of the tongue into the hollow of the
palate, the tip turned downwards, and forcing the sound through the
nose, with the mouth open. It is chiefly used before letters of its
own class; but in Dēva-nāgari manuscripts, as is the case with the
other nasals, it is generally expressed by [ं] _anuswārah_. It seldom
appears with another consonant immediately before, or a vowel after
it: indeed there are but few instances of it, (except in grammatical
compositions,) one of which is in the root ज्ञा _jnā_, signifying
_know_, and its derivatives, where the character ज्ञ is said to be
a compound of ज _ja_ and ञ _ṅa_, the just articulation of which is
found so difficult, and the sound so harsh, that it is frequently
softened into _gyā_, as if written ग्या. As the sound of ण before
another consonant approaches nearer to that of _n_ than any other
letter, it may be represented by it, with a mark over it, thus, _ṅ_.


_The Third Class, or Cerebrals, ट ठ ड ढ ण._

This series of consonants is pronounced by turning and applying the
tip of the tongue far back against the palate; which producing a
hollow sound, as if proceeding from the head, it is distinguished by
the term मूर्द्धन्य _mūrddhanya_, which Mr. Halhed, in his Grammar of
the Bengal Language, has translated _cerebral_.

ट _ṭa_ has the sound of _t_, articulated as above directed.

ठ _ṭha_ is the same aspirated.

ड _ḍa_ differs from the common _d_ only in the above particular. In
Bengal it is generally pronounced like a very obtuse _r_.

ढ _ḍha_ is the same aspirated.

ण _ṇa_ is distinguished from the common _n_ by the manner of
producing it, as above.

In our letters those of this class may be conveniently expressed by a
dot under ṭ, ḍ, ṇ.


_The Fourth Class, or Dentals, त थ द ध न._

त _ta_ is the common dental _t_.

थ _tha_ is the former aspirated.

द _da_ has the power of our _d_.

ध _dha_ is the aspirate of द _da_.

न _na_ is the common _n_. It is sometimes, like the other nasals,
represented by _anuswāra_ [ं].


_The Fifth Class, or Labials, प फ ब भ म._

प _pa_ corresponds with _p_.

फ _pha_ is the former aspirated. In writing foreign words with these
characters, this letter is used for the sound of _f_.

ब _ba_. This letter is very often confounded with व _va_. Its power
is that of _b_.

भ _bha_ is the aspirate of ब _ba_.

म _ma_ is _m_. When silent it is often expressed by [ं] _anuswāra_;
as in संवत् _samvat_, A year, an æra.


_The Semi-Vowels, य र ल व._

य _ya_. This letter, which is a palatal, like our _y_ (with which
it corresponds), is often put in the place of इ _i_ and ई _ī_. Its
proper power is that of _y_ in _yarn_; but in Bengal they generally
pronounce it as we do _j_, confounding it with ज _ja_.

र _ra_ is our _r_. It is esteemed a _cerebral_. In composition
it frequently assumes two other forms. In the middle of a word,
immediately preceding another consonant, it is mounted upon its head
in this shape [#], when it is optional in the writer to double the
letter with which it so coalesces: as in the word कार्य्य _kāryya_,
An affair, which is pronounced _kārya_. After a consonant it is
always subjoined in this shape [#], as in the word प्रकार _prakāra_,
A sort or manner. This letter, in grammars, is generally called रेफ
_rēpha_.

ल _la_ answers to our _l_. It is ranked among _dentals_.

व _va_ is generally pronounced like _v_, and is then a dento-labial;
but when subjoined to another consonant, it is often necessarily
articulated as our _w_, it being then frequently the natural
substitute for उ _u_ before another vowel; as द्वौ _ḍwau_, Two.


_The Sibilants and Aspirate, ष ष स ह._

ष _ṣa_. The proper sound of this letter is produced by applying the
tip of the tongue to the fore-part of the palate, and passing the
voice as in pronouncing our _s_, from which it may be distinguished
by a dot under it, thus, _ṣ_. It is a _palatal_.

ष _sha_ is generally pronounced as _sh_ in _shoe_; but in the western
parts of India it is frequently articulated like, and confounded with
ख _kha_. It is a _cerebral_.

स _sa_ has precisely the power of _s_ in Saint, and is esteemed a
_dental_.

ह _ha_ is _h_. At the end of a word, when silent, it is represented
by [ः] _visarga_. It is classed among gutturals. This properly is the
last letter in the alphabet, [#] _ksha_, as before observed, being a
compound character.

There is another letter, not usually given in the Dēva-nāgar
alphabet, in this form, ॡ, which seems to have a power similar to
that of the surd, or Welsh _ll_. It occurs in the _Vēdas_, and is
included in some of the provincial alphabets.


OF COMPOUND CONSONANTS.

The sound of अ _a_, it has been already mentioned, is given to
every open consonant, not followed by another vowel; but as it must
often happen that a word ends with a consonant, or that two or more
consonants meet together without a vowel between them, it is proper
the learner should know what is done in these two cases. If a word
terminates in a consonant, the vowel is cut off by a small mark of
elision, such as is seen under क _ka_ in the word वाक् _vāk_, Speech,
which written without it, thus, वाक, would be pronounced _vāka_. If
two or more consonants meet together, it is a general rule that they
coalesce, and form a compound character. Sometimes it so happens that
the simple letters are not to be traced in the compound, instances
of which occur in [#] _ksha_, and क्ष _jṅa_, which are composed of
क and श, and ज and ण; but, in general, the shapes of the letters
are so little altered, that they may be easily discriminated. There
are several modes of forming these compounds: sometimes it is found
convenient to put one letter under the other, and at others to blend
them together, thus, द्ध; but the most usual way is to place them
in their natural order, yet so that their bodies, as well as heads,
may be in contact, omitting the final upright stroke of every letter
that has one, except the last. In the word कार्त्स्न्यं _kārtsnyam_,
Wholeness, there is a coalition of no less than five consonants;
namely, र, त, स, न, and य; _ra_, in a new shape, is mounted upon
the head, and त _ta_, स _sa_, and न _na_, deprived of their upright
strokes, thus, [#] [#] [#], are connected, and finally united to य
_ya_. A little practice will render this subject familiar to the
learner.


OF EXTRANEOUS CHARACTERS.

One stroke, thus [#], or two, thus [#], serve to divide hemistichs
and distichs.

A sort of sigma, in this shape, [#], is frequently used as an
apostrophe, to show that a vowel has been dropped by rule.

A character like a crescent, with a dot between its horns, thus,
ँ, is occasionally put over a consonant, which by the rules of
orthography has been substituted for a nasal.

In the _Vēda_ other diacritical marks are used, which do not occur
in common books. A small perpendicular line over a vowel, thus अ॑,
denotes that it is to be pronounced _high_; a parallel line drawn
under a vowel, thus अ॒, denotes that it should be pronounced _low_;
and a curved line over a vowel, thus [#], indicates that it must be
pronounced in a manner to partake of both the former. The intention
of these three marks seems to be the same as what was originally
designed by the acute, the grave, and the circumflex accents. A
figure of three is sometimes put after a vowel, thus अ३, or three
lines over it, thus [#], to show that it is to be held longer than
usual, as in calling, or crying.

Two dots, thus ः, called _visarga_ (विसर्ग:), are used to denote a
final [#]. They are occasionally represented in this manner [#].

A single dot over a letter, thus अं, is called _anuswārah_
(अनुस्वार:), and denotes a final nasal.

The numerical figures are,

  १  २  ३  ४  ५  ६  ७  ८  ९  ०
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0

In the _Vēdas_, the character for ं _anuswāra_, before व, स, ह, and
र, is in this form, [#]; so for [###] is written [###].

SAW. A small thin saw, with a back to strengthen it, to cut furniture
with. I would have the blade much narrower than it generally is, so
broad only as to cut fairly through the furniture, before the back
stops it from cutting deeper by resting on the saw block; it would
then prevent the saw block from being cut so much as it generally is
in a careless manner, sometimes even through at the front, till the
saw comes in contact with the stone, and is spoiled.


SAW BLOCK. A piece of wood on which to cut furniture to certain
lengths; it is similar to a carpenter’s mitre block, with the
addition of a cut at right angles. The customary place for using it
is on the fore edge of the imposing stone.

For anꝺ the Saxons used these abbreviations, ⁊ and [#]; for þaꞇ and
þæꞇ they wrote ꝥ; and for oððe _or_, and the termination lıce _ly_,
they wrote ł; as ł or; and ꞅoðł for ꞅoðlıce _truly_.

[_Note._] We also find uł for _or_; Ƿıłłm. for Ƿıllelm, William;
and [H]æł, for [H]ælenꝺ, _Jesus_; ł stands for leoꝼeꞅꞇan, φίλτατοι,
amicissimi, _most friendly_ or _beloved_; apł, ap̃, or ap°, for
apoꞅole, _an apostle_; apłar, _apostles_; [H]ieꞃłm, _Jerusalem_,;
ꞅcıł, _a shilling_, _money_.

When an m was omitted, they made a short stroke over the preceding

ƿũꞇ, ƿuꞇoꝺlıce, _certainly_, &c. See Thwaites, p. 1.

In studying the Anglo-Saxon tongue, it is of great consequence to
remark, that the inevitable changes introduced by the lapse of time
through successive ages; the existence of the three great dialects,
and their frequent intermixture; the variety of Anglo-Saxon writers,
and their little acquaintance with each other; but, above all, their
total disregard of any settled rules of orthography; have occasioned
many irregularities in the language, and thrown difficulties in the
way of the learner, which at first sight appear truly formidable;
but, on closer inspection, these difficulties present no insuperable
obstacle.

The principal difficulty consists in this: The Anglo-Saxon writers
often confounded some letters, and used them indifferently for each
other. This is the case to a most surprising extent with the vowels
and diphthongs; so that the consonants, though often treated in the
same manner, form the only part of the language which possesses any
thing like a fixed and permanent character.


_Remarks on the Change of the Consonants required for derivation and
declension._

B.

B, F, or U, are often interchanged; as

Bebeꞃ, beꝼoꞃ, _a beaver_. Iꝼıᵹ, ıueᵹ _ivy_. Obeꞃ, oꝼeꞃ, oueꞃ, _over_.
[E]bolꞅan, eꝼolꞅan _to blaspheme_. Foꞇ, uoꞇ _a foot_.

C.

C often interchanges with G, K and Q; as

Ðonceꞅ, þonᵹeꞅ _thoughts_. [C]ẏð, kẏð _kindred_. [C]ẏnınᵹ, kẏnınᵹ _a
king_. Aceꞃ, Akeꞃ _a field_. [C]ƿen, quen, _a queen, wife, &c._

C and CC are also often changed into H, or Hh, before ꞅ or ð, and
especially before ꞇ; as Sꞇꞃehꞇon _they strewed_, for ꞅꞇꞃecꞇon, from
ꞅꞇꞃeccan. Ahꞅıan for acꞅıan or axıan _to ask_. ꞅehđ for ꞅecđ _seeks_,
from ꞅecan _to seek_.

In Dan. Sax. C changes into ᵹ, h, hƿ and k; and ch changes into h.

D.

D and T are often used indiscriminately for each other, and Ð is
changed into ꝺ, especially in verbs; as ꞅeođan _to boil_ or _seeth_;
ꞅoꝺen _boiled_, ıc cƿæđ _I said_; þu cƿæ đe _thou saidst_. he ƿẏꞃđ
_he is_ or _becomes_; þu ƿuꞃꝺe _thou becomest_.

F.

In Dan. Sax. F changes into b and p.

G.

G is often changed into h and ƿ; as [H]eꞃeꞇoha for heꞃeꞇoᵹa _a
leader_; Dahum for ꝺaᵹum _with days_; Geꞅƿıᵹan _to be silent_;
ᵹeꞅuƿoꝺe _he was silent_ or _dumb_; ꞅoꞃh for ꞅoꞃᵹe _sorrow_.

G interchanges with I and Y, when I has a sort of a consonant sound;
as ᵹeo, ıeo or ıu _yore, formerly_; ᵹeoᵹuđ, ıeoᵹuđ _youth_; ᵹeoc, ıoc
or ıuc _yoke_.

G is often suppressed before n, or ᵹn lengthened into ᵹen; as
þẏꞅıᵹne, Þẏꞅıne from þyꞅꞅ or þıꞅ _this_, and ænıᵹne, aenıne, from
aenıᵹ _any_. G is often added to words that end with ı, as hıᵹ for hı
_they_; and on the contrary G is often omitted in those words which
end in ıᵹ; as ꝺꞃı for ꝺꞃıᵹ or ꝺꞃẏᵹ, _dry_.

In Dan. Sax. G is sometimes dropped, or changed into C, H, or K; and
GS into X.

H.

[H] is sometimes changed into ᵹ; as þaᵹ for þah _he grew_ or
_throve_, from þean _to grow_.

In Dan. Sax. [H] is sometimes added to words, and sometimes dropped;
or it is changed into c, ᵹ, ch, or k; and [H]u into ƿ.

K.

The Saxons originally expressed the sound of the modern K by C. As C
also stood for a soft sound, it was difficult to know when it was to
be sounded hard, and when soft. To remove this difficulty, the Danes
and Normans introduced the letter K to denote the hard sound of C.

L.

L and N are often written double or single without any distinction at
the end of monosyllables; but this reduplication ceases when words
are lengthened, so that a consonant follows; as ƿell or ƿel _well_;
ealle or al _all_ (omnis); ealne, _all_ (omnem); also ıc ꞅẏlle, þu
ꞅẏlꞅꞇ, he ꞅylđ, _I sell_, _thou_, &c.

In Dan. Sax. L is sometimes put for R.

M and N.

In Dan. Sax. these two letters are sometimes interchangeable; and N
is occasionally dropped.

P.

The Saxon p and ƿ are easily mistaken for each other, both in MSS.
and on coins; and even in printed books great care is sometimes
necessary to distinguish these letters.

In Dan. Sax. P changes occasionally into B and U.

Q.

Q is not an original Saxon letter, and very seldom occurs in MSS.; Cw
and Cu were commonly employed where Q is now used.

R.

R in Dan. Sax. is occasionally added to words, and is sometimes
changed into L.

S.

S and Z are merely variations of the same original letter. The Z is
only the S hard.

In Dan. Sax. Ss, Ð, or X are sometimes substituted for S.

T.

T in Dan. Sax. occasionally changes into D and Ð.

W.

In Dan. Sax. W changes into F and Ui; We into oe, u, ue; Wi, into u,
uu; Wa, into uıæ, ƿæ; Wr, into war; and Wu, into u.

X.

X is sometimes supplied by cꞅ; as neoꞃcꞅen for neoꞃxen _quiet_. In
Dan. Sax. X interchanges with S.

Z.

Z is only the S hard. See S.


_Remarks on the Vowels and Diphthongs._

If the consonants,--those natural sinews of words and
language,--suffer such changes, it may safely be presumed, that
those flexible and yielding symbols, the vowels, would be exposed to
still greater confusion; a confusion almost sufficient to induce one
to imagine that they are of no weight or authority, in Anglo-Saxon
orthography.

A.

A kind of Italic a is much used in Anglo-Saxon MSS. Where we now use
A or E, the diphthongs Æ, Œ, and Ea continually occur in Anglo-Saxon;
but Œ more frequently in Dan. Sax.

The vowel A and its diphthongs thus interchange.

A and O. See under O.

A and Æ: as ac, æc _an oak_; aceꞃ, æceꞃ _a field_; habban _to have_,
ıc hæbbe _I have_; ꞅꞇan _a stone_; ꞅꞇænen _stony_; laꞃ _doctrine_;
læꞃan _to teach_; an _one_; æniᵹ _any one_.

Æ and EA: as æ, ea _water_; æc, eac _eternal_.

Æ and Œ: as aeᵹhƿeꞃ, ceᵹhƿeꞃ _everywhere_; aeᵹhƿilc, oeᵹhƿilc _every
one_.

Æ and Y: as ælc, ẏlc _each one_.

In Dan. Sax. these occur indifferently:--A, æ, e, ea, o, eo; Æ, e,
ıe, œ, o, ea, ue.

E.

E interchanges with [Æ]. It is often added to the end of Anglo-Saxon
words where it does not naturally belong, and it is as often rejected
where it does.

Eo is changed into ẏ and e, and ea into e, but more usually into ẏ.

[E]aðe, eðe _easily_; and ceaᵹreꞃ, cereeꞃ _a castle_.

[S]eolꝼ, ꞅelꝼ, ꞅẏlꝼ _self_; ꞅẏllan, ꞅellan _to give, sell_, &c.

Neah near; nehꞅꞇ _nearest_; ealꝺ _old_; ꞅe ẏlꝺꞃa _the elder_; ƿealꝺan
_to rule_, he ƿelꞇ or ƿẏlꞇ _he rules_; leaꞅ _loose_, lẏꞅan _to
loose_; ᵹeleaꝼa _belief_, ᵹelẏꝼan _to believe_.

In Dan. Sax. these occur indifferently:--E, a, eo, ce, O, u, as, ea,
ẏ; ea, eo, ı, ẏ; eau, eoƿ; ee, e; eı, œ, ı; eo, a, e, ı, ıƿ, u; eu,
ẏƿ.

I.

I is interchanged with e and y; as

Iᵹlanb, eᵹlanb, ẏᵹlanb _an island_; eꝼel, ẏᵹel _evil_; ıꞃþımᵹ,
eaꞃþımᵹ, ẏꞃþlınᵹ _a farmer_; ꞃen _rain_, ꞃınan _to rain_; beꞃnan _to
burn_, bẏꞃnan _to set on fire_; cƿeþan _to say_, þu cƿyꞅꞇ, cƿıꞅꞇ,
_thou sayest_.

In Dan. Sax. these occur indifferently: I, ıa, ıo, eo, ẏ; ıœ, ıe, œ;
ıuh, eoƿ.

O.

O is changed into u, e and ẏ, and eo into ẏ; but sometimes into a,
especially before n in a short or terminating syllable.

Oꝺe and oꝺ, into aꝺe and aꝺ; ꝺom _ᵹudgment_, ꝺeman _to judge_; ꝼꞃoꝼeꞃ
_comfort_, ꝼꞃeꝼꞃtan _to comfort_; ꝼoc _a foot_, ꝼec _feet_; boc _a
book_, bee _books_; ꞅcoꞃm _a storm_, ꞅcẏꞃman _to storm_; ᵹolꝺ _gold_,
ᵹẏlꝺen _golden_; ƿoꞃb _a word_, anꝺƿyꞃꝺan _to answer_; ƿeoꞃc _a
work_, ƿẏꞃcean _to work_; heoꞃb or hẏꞃꝺe _a herd_; ıoc, ıuc me _a
yoke_; leƿan, ᵹoƿan _to show_; man and mon _a man_; lanᵹ and lonᵹ
_long_; ꞅanꝺ and ꞅonꝺ _sand_.

In Dan. Sax. these occur:--O, a, e, I, u; œ, æ, e, o, ue, ƿe; oea,
eo; oƿe, uu.

U.

U is sometimes converted into ẏ: as ꞅcꞃuꝺ _clothing_, ꞅcꞃyꝺan _to
clothe_; cuþ _known_, cẏþan _to make known_.

In Dan. Sax. these are used indiscriminately:--U, ꝺ, ꝼ, o, oƿ, ƿe,
ƿı, ƿu; ue, æ, œ, ƿe; uı, ƿ; uu, oƿe.

Y.

The Anglo-Saxon Y is the Greek Υ (upsilon), or, as the French call
it, y Greque. The ẏ was not dotted in the oldest MSS.

Y is sometimes changed into u.

In Dan. Sax. these occur:--Y into e, ea, ı; and Yƿ into eu.


_Further Remarks on the Letters._

The preceding observations on the consonants and vowels will render
the following peculiarities less surprising, and may perhaps explain
their causes.

The final letters of words are often omitted: as ƿomb, ƿom; ƿæᵹ or
ƿeᵹ, ƿe.

A vowel near, or at the end of a word, is often absorbed by the
preceding or succeeding consonant, especially if that consonant be a
semi-vowel; but either that or the nearest vowel is still understood:
as Luꝼꞅꞇ for luꝼaꞅꞇ _lovest_; luꝼð for luꝼað _loveth_; and other
verbs in the 2d and 3d persons. Geƿꞃıxl for ᵹeƿꞃıxle _changes_;
ꞅuꞅl ꞅuꞅel _sulphur_; ꞅƿæꝼl for ꞅƿæꝼel _sulphur_; bloꞅm for bloꞅma
_a blossom_; boꞅm for boꞅum _bosom_; boꞇl for boꞇle a _village_,
_house_, &c.; bꞃıꝺl for bꞃıꝺel _a bridle_.

Contractions of words are common: as N’ẏꞅꞇe for ne ƿıꞅꞇ _knew not_;
n’æꝼꝺe for ne hæꝼeꝺ _had not_; ẏꞃn’ð for ẏꞃneð _runneth_.

In Dan. Sax., on the other hand, monosyllables are sometimes changed
into longer words: as ƿꞃað _anger_, _wrath_, lengthened into ƿaꞃað.
Other words contract two syllables into one; as cẏnınᵹ into kẏnᵹ _a
king_.

The different letters suffer a very frequent change of position: as
ꞇınꞇeꞃᵹe, ꞇınꞇꞃeᵹe _pain_; þıꞃꝺa, þꞃıꝺꝺa _third_.

A very great variety exists in writing the same word by different
Anglo-Saxon authors, as will appear from the following examples:
ᵹeoᵹeþe, ᵹeoᵹoð, ᵹeoᵹuð, ᵹeᵹoþe, ıoᵹoð, ıuᵹuð _youth_; mæneᵹeo
_many_, _a multitude_, is written mæneᵹo, mænıᵹeo, mænıᵹo, mænıᵹu,
mænıo, mænıu, mænẏᵹeo, maneᵹeo, maneᵹu, manıᵹe, manıᵹo, manıᵹu,
meneᵹeo, meneᵹo, meneᵹu, menıᵹeo, menıᵹo, menıᵹu, menıo, menıu.

Adjectives in the comparative degree end indifferently in aꞃ, æꞃ, eꞃ,
ıꞃ, oꞃ, uꞃ, or ẏꞃ; and the superlative in aꞅꞇ, æꞅꞇ, eꞅꞇ, ıꞅꞇ, oꞅꞇ,
uꞅꞇ, or ẏꞅꞇ.

Active participles end in anꝺ, anꝺe, ænꝺ, ænꝺe, enꝺ, ınꝺ, onꝺ, unꝺ or
ẏnꝺ; and passive participles in aꝺ, æꝺ, eꝺ, ıꝺ, oꝺ, uꝺ, or ẏꝺ.

So also, [H]e ꝺıelꝼ, ꝺealꝼ, ꝺelꝼ or ꝺalꝼ _he dug_; and læꞅƿenꝺe,
læꞅƿıᵹenꝺe, læꞅᵹenꝺe or læꞅıenꝺe _feeding_; ıc ƿuꞃpe, ıc ƿeoꞃpe, ıc
ƿẏꞃpe, or ıc ƿeꞃpe _I cast away_; man, mon _a man_; he mæᵹe or muᵹe
_he may_; he ꞅıᵹ, ꞅı, ꞅıe, ꞅe, ꞅıo, or ꞅeo _he is_; ꞅınꝺon, ꞅenꝺon,
ꞅıenꝺon, ꞅınꞇ, ꞅıenꞇ, ꞅınꝺ, ꞅın, ꞅıen, ꞅeon, _are_.

Some short words assume very different meanings: as bıᵹ, bıᵹe,
bẏᵹe, beᵹ, beaᵹ, beah and beh, which, according to their connexion,
signify indifferently, _a turning_, _a crown_, _a gem_, _a bosom_,
_buy_, _he turned_, _he submitted_, &c. from buᵹan, _to turn_,
_bow_, _&c._--_The Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar. By the Rev. J.
Bosworth_, M.A. F.A.S., 8_vo_. 1823.

“The Saxon capitals which vary from those now used are C, E, G, H,
M, and W. The small letters are d, f, g, r, s, t, and w, which are
all Roman, except the Ƿ, ƿ, and some notes of abbreviations used by
the Saxons, as Ð ð, þ th, ꝥ _that_, &c. Many other abbreviations
were used by the Saxons. These notes of abbreviation are _not_ the
original members of an alphabet; they were the result of later
reflection, and were introduced for dispatch.

“By an attentive observation of the different specimens of writing
in England, we perceive the several gradations of change, by which
one form of a Roman character has imperceptibly changed into another.
The Saxon ƿ, says Mr. Whitaker, seems to have been only the Roman V
at first, and to have been lengthened into the Saxon character, and
enlarged into the present Roman W, by bringing the principal stroke
somewhat lower, and closing the top in the one, and by redoubling
the whole in the other. The W is unknown, both to the Latin and its
daughter languages, the French, the Spanish, and the Italian: it is
composed of two characters, namely of the V or U doubled.

“The writing which prevailed in England from the coming of St.
Augustin, in 596, to the middle of the eleventh century, is generally
termed SAXON, and may be divided into five kinds, namely, the ROMAN
SAXON, the SET SAXON, the RUNNING HAND SAXON, the MIXED SAXON, and
the ELEGANT SAXON.”--_Astle_.

_Elegant Saxon._--This writing was adopted in England in the tenth
century, and was continued till the Norman conquest; but was not
entirely disused till the middle of the thirteenth century.

All subsequent Saxon writers endeavour to keep as near as possible
to the form of the letters in a book of Saxon Homilies in the
Lambeth Library (No. 439), written in the tenth century. There is
a beautiful specimen in the MSS. of the Rev. E. Thwaites, M. A. to
be found in the Harleian MSS., at the British Museum (No. 1866). It
is described in Nichols’s _Lit. Anec._, vol. iv. p. 140, as “one
of the most lovely specimens of modern Saxon writing that can be
imagined.”--_Bosworth_, p. 20.

About the year 1567, John Daye, who was patronized by Archbishop
Parker, cut the first Saxon types which were used in England. In
this year Asserius Menevensis was published by the direction of the
archbishop in these characters; and in the same year Archbishop
Ælfric’s _Paschal Homily_; and, in 1571, the Saxon Gospels. Daye’s
Saxon types far excel in neatness and beauty any which have been
since made, not excepting the neat types cast for F. Junius at Dort,
which were given by him to the University of Oxford. Astle, p.
224.--_Bosworth_.

“The _Saxon_ types which were used in printing _St. Gregory’s_
Homily, having been burnt in the fire which consumed Mr. _Bowyer’s_
house and all his printing materials [Jan. 30. 1712-13], Lord Chief
Justice _Parker_ was so munificently indulgent, as to be at the
expence of cutting a new _Saxon_ type for Mrs. _Elstob’s_ Saxon
Grammar, from _fac similes_ by Mrs. _Elstob_; the punches and
matrices of which Mr. _Bowyer’s_ son presented, by the hands of
_Edward Rowe-Mores_, esq; to the University of _Oxford_. See the
Archæologia Antiq. Soc vol. i. p. xxvii.”--_Gent. Mag., Oct._ 1778,
p. 455. Note.

SCALE OF PRICES.

The following scale of prices is copied literally
from the official scale published by the master printers in 1810.
The alteration in the scale in 1816, as well as the subsequent
alterations and explanations have been also accurately copied from
the official notifications issued to the trade by the committee of
master printers.

“Scale of Prices for Compositor’s Work,

  “_Agreed upon at a General Meeting of Master Printers, at
  Stationers’ Hall, April_ 16, 1810; _commencing on all Volumes or
  Periodical Numbers begun after the 30th Instant._

“ART. 1. All works in the English language, common matter, _with
space lines_, including English and Brevier, to be cast up at 5¾d.
per 1000; if in Minion 6d. per 1000; in Nonpareil 6¾d. _Without
space lines_, including English and Brevier, 6d. per 1000; in Minion
6¼d. in Nonpareil 7d.; in Pearl, _with or without space lines_, 8d.;

be considered an en in the width, and an en to be reckoned an em in
the length of the page: and where the number of letters amounts to
500--1000 to be charged; if under 500, not to be reckoned: and, if
the calculation at per 1000 shall not amount to an odd threepence,
the odd pence to be suppressed in the price of the work; but where it
amounts to or exceeds threepence, there shall be sixpence charged.
Em and en quadrats, or whatever is used at the beginning or end of
lines, to be reckoned as an em in the width.

“2. Works printed in Great Primer to be cast up as English; and all
works in larger type than Great Primer, as half English and half
Great Primer.

“3. All works in foreign languages, though common type, _with space
lines_, including English and Brevier, to be cast up at 6¼d. per
1000; if in Minion 6¾d.; Nonpareil 7½d. _Without space lines_,
including English and Brevier, 6½d.; Minion 7d.; Nonpareil 7¾d.; and
Pearl, _with or without space lines_, 8¾d.

“4. English Dictionaries of every size, _with space lines_, including
English and Brevier, to be paid 6¼d.: _without space lines_,

“10. Works requiring an alteration or alterations of margin, to be
paid, for each alteration, 1s. per sheet to the Pressmen if altered
by them, and 6d. to the Compositor, as a compensation for making up
the furniture; if altered by the Compositor, then he is to be paid

article to be determined on solely at the option of the employer.

“11. Bottom Notes consisting of twenty lines (or two notes, though
not amounting to twenty lines) and not exceeding four pages, in every
ten sheets, in quarto or octavo:--one page (or two notes, though not
amounting to one page) and not exceeding six pages, in twelves:--two
pages (or two notes, though not amounting to two pages) and not
exceeding eight, in eighteens or above, to be paid 1s. per sheet;
but under the above proportion no charge to be made. Bottom Notes,
consisting of ten lines (or two notes, though not amounting to ten
lines) in a pamphlet of five sheets or under, and not exceeding two

  * The following interpretation of this article of the scale is
  given in a resolution of the committee of the master printers
  association, published in their fourth report, [3d July, 1840,]
  viz. “‘That there must be _two Notes in every_ 10 _sheets_ of a
  work to constitute the charge of 1_s_. per sheet for notes.’ _E.
  g._ if there should be only two notes, less than 20 lines each,
  in a work of _more than_ 10 sheets, such work would not be liable
  to _any charge_ for notes.”

“12. Side Notes to Folios and Quartos not exceeding a broad
quotation, if only chap. or date, and not exceeding three explanatory
lines on an average in each page, to be paid 1s. per sheet; in

lines on an average in each page, 1s. 6d. per sheet. Cut-in
Notes, in smaller type than the body, to be paid for in a similar
manner.----Side and Bottom Notes to many, particularly historical and
law works, if attended with more than ordinary trouble, to be settled
between the employer and journeyman.

“13. Greek, Hebrew, Saxon, &c. or any of the dead characters, if one
word and not exceeding three lines in any one sheet, to be paid for
that sheet 1s. extra; all above to be paid according to their value.

“14. Greek _with space lines_, and without accents, to be paid 8½d.
per 1000, if with separate accents 10d.; _without space lines_, and
without accents, 8¾d.; with accents, 10¼d.; the asper not to be
considered an accent. [If Dictionary matter, to take one halfpenny
advance.]

“15. Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, &c. to be paid double: Hebrew with
points to be cast up as half body and half points doubled.

the dimensions of crown, whether table or common matter, to be paid
the double of common matter; on crown and under, to be paid one and
one half common matter.--The indorse to be paid one fourth of the
inside page, as common matter.

“23. All Corrections to be paid 6d. per hour.

A modification of the Compositors’ Scale took place in 1816, and the
following notification was issued to the Trade:--

  “At a Meeting of Master Printers held this day, pursuant to
  notice, for the purpose of taking into consideration the state
  of the Trade in general, in consequence of the alteration in the
  times;

“It was the opinion of this Meeting, that it would be highly
expedient that, after the 19th of February, the following
modification of the Compositors’ Scale of Prices of 1810, as far as
regards Reprints, should take place.

“All Reprinted Works to be paid Three Farthings per 1000 less than
the Scale of 1810. All Manuscript or Original Works shall continue to
be paid for as at present.

  “January 2. 1816.”

The following resolution is copied from Hansard’s Typographia:

  “_At a Meeting of the Committee of Master Printers held March_
  11, 1816.

“It having been stated that doubts had arisen in the minds of several
Masters as to what should be considered ‘Reprinted Works,’--Resolved,
That they be informed that, under the above Resolutions, all
‘Reprinted Works’ were meant to be comprehended, whether printed
sheet for sheet or otherwise; it being understood, that, in cases
where the copy is rendered peculiarly troublesome by intricate
manuscript insertions, a reasonable allowance may be made for the
same to the Compositor.”


Reprints, according to the Resolution of January 2, 1816.

  * In the Abstract under the head “Dictionaries,” the prices for
  Minion and Nonpareil are erroneous, being one farthing too much;
  this error passed unnoticed, till the publication of the “Third
  Report of the Committee of the Association of Master Printers” in
  1839, where it is corrected. I have given the Scale as originally
  published.

SIR,

I herewith transmit to you an Extract from the Proceedings which
have taken place at a SPECIAL MEETING of the Committee convened this
day for the purpose of “considering the case of the Refusal of the
Compositors in Mr. BENTLEY’S Office to work upon his Magazine; and
with a view to Conformity of Practice in our several Offices.”

    “The Committee of Master Printers being informed that claims
    have been made by Compositors in some Offices for all Wrappers
    and Advertising Sheets to be set up by such Compositors only as
    were employed on the Periodicals to which they are attached, it
    was

    “UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED,

      “That such claim on the part of the Compositors is an
      innovation on the antient and accustomed usages of the Trade,
      and wholly incompatible with that control which a Master
      has a right to exercise over the mode of conducting his own
      business; and that such claim will in future be resisted by
      every Member of this Committee.”

  “It having been stated by Mr. BENTLEY, that the Compositors
  in his Office had refused to proceed with his Magazine in
  consequence of his having acted on the general understanding of
  the Committee, that the Compositors were not entitled to the
  Standing Advertisements in Periodicals,

    “IT WAS RESOLVED,

      “That Compositors are not entitled to such _Standing
      Advertisements_, or to any _Standing Matter_, such claim
      being also contrary to the antient and established practice
      of the Trade.

      “That the above Resolutions be circulated among the Members
      of the ASSOCIATION, and that they be strongly recommended to
      act with the Committee in carrying them into effect.”

                                        I am, Sir,
                                              Your obedient Servant,
                                                      W. M‘DOWALL,
                                                           _Hon. Sec._


EXTRACT FROM

  “THIRD REPORT _of the_ COMMITTEE OF THE MASTER PRINTERS’
  ASSOCIATION _to the Annual General Meeting, held at Anderton’s
  Coffee House, July_ 5. 1839.”

“In adverting to the dispute respecting Wrappers, which originated
in a case submitted at the Monthly Meeting in December, the Committee
feel it to be due to the Members of the Association to acknowledge
the ready support which they have on all occasions afforded them.
To that firm co-operation on their part, no less than to the
reasonableness of the Deputation appointed by the Compositors to
confer with the Committee, may be attributed the very satisfactory
adjustment of a question which had been a source of serious
disagreement in several Offices.

“The following are the Regulations ultimately agreed upon, a copy of
which has been sent to each Member of the Association:--

    “That the Companionship on a Magazine or Review be entitled
    to the first or title-page of the Wrapper of such Magazine or
    Review; but not to the remaining pages of such Wrapper, nor
    to the Advertising Sheets which may accompany the Magazine or
    Review.

    “That Standing Advertisements or stereo-blocks, if forming a
    complete page, or, when collected together, making one or more
    complete pages, in a Wrapper or Advertising Sheet of a Magazine
    or Review, shall not be chargeable: the Compositor to charge
    only for his time in making them up. The remainder of the
    matter in such Wrapper or Advertising Sheet, including Standing
    Advertisements or stereo-blocks not forming a complete page,
    to be charged by the Compositor, and cast up according to the
    8th or 20th Rules of the Scale, as they may respectively apply.
    But the charge of 2_s._ 6_d._ as given by Rule 7. is not to be
    superadded.

    “With regard to Standing Matter, the Committee adhere to their
    Resolution of December 10th, 1838.”

Having thus given an accurate copy of the official scale of 1810,
with the alterations and explanations of the master printers, to the
present time, I shall now add the explanation published by the London
Union of Compositors, of the different articles of the scale.

  Article I.] “In casting up a work, although it be printed in
  half sheets, it is cast up in sheets; in jobs less than a
  sheet, however, the casting-up is confined to the job, and the
  compositor loses or gains the five hundred letters, or the
  threepence (as stated in Art. 1.) as the case may chance to be.

  “By the term _common matter_ is understood the usual description
  of Bookwork, and not such matter as Appeal Cases, Bills in
  Parliament, &c. for which peculiar and distinct charges are
  made.--_See Appendix._

  _Space Lines._--The reason of pearl being always paid the same
  price (whether leaded with a lead equal to its own body in
  thickness, or without a lead) has often excited surprise; but
  this surprise will cease when we learn that in the year 1810,
  when an advance of one halfpenny on leaded, and three farthings
  on solid took place, _no advance whatever_ was made on the price
  of pearl, which consequently when solid, which it most frequently
  is, does not have that advance which was granted in 1810; and the
  compositor in casting it up at 8d. receives only the price which
  was paid thirty years back. In 1805, the difference between the
  price of nonpareil and pearl was seven farthings; in 1810, the
  difference was one penny.

  _Head and White Lines._--The head or folio line and the white
  or direction line are invariably reckoned in the square of the
  page. Head lines, when set up in a smaller type than the body
  of the work, are charged one shilling per sheet; and if any
  justification of figures, &c. occur, an allowance is made for
  extra trouble; but if the head be in larger type than the text,
  no extra charge can be made.

  “_Reprints._--Annual Reports of societies, with lists of
  subscribers, &c. are not reprints. If the copy for a book be
  print-copy, but derived from various sources, such book is
  an original work, and paid for as manuscript. Works with MS.
  insertions are paid extra per sheet--not less than 1s.,--but if
  materially altered or much interlined, or consisting of half
  manuscript and half reprint, are considered as original works,
  and paid for as if they were all manuscript. Reprinted pamphlets
  (when more than one sheet) are subject to the reduction above
  specified. No reduction is made for printed copy introduced into
  magazines, reviews, &c.

  “_Diamond._--It is the custom of the trade to pay tenpence per
  thousand for diamond, whether leaded or unleaded.

  “_Ruby._--This description of letter is not common, but it is
  paid an intermediate price allowed for those bodies between which
  it is cast; thus, a ruby (which is less than nonpareil and larger
  than a pearl) is cast up at 7½d. leaded or unleaded.”

  Art. II.] “This mode of casting up works, which was agreed to
  in 1796, applies also to jobs, but not to large-letter display
  broadsides, the charge for which will be found in the Appendix.”

  Art. III.] “In the scale of 1805, foreign works in bourgeois
  and brevier were paid one farthing per thousand extra; but in
  1810 one price was established for type from english to brevier
  inclusive.

  “Works in the German language and common type are paid the same
  as other foreign works; but if the German character be employed,
  it is paid as Greek without accents. The same price is also paid
  for the Irish character.”

  Art. IV.] “The words ‘of every size,’ allude to the dimensions
  of the page; because formerly (that is, by the scale of 1801)
  duodecimo and eighteenmo dictionaries were paid one halfpenny per
  thousand more than those set up in octavo or quarto.

  “In framing the above article, it was intended that such
  gazetteers or dictionaries of the arts and sciences as were
  attended with _any extra trouble_ beyond usual descriptive matter
  should be paid the above dictionary price; and therefore, such
  gazetteers or dictionaries as contain many references, italics,
  contractions, &c. take the advanced price as dictionary matter.

  “If the above works are in two columns an extra charge of not
  less than one shilling per sheet is made for column matter.”

  Art. V.] “There is a strange anomaly in this article. It was
  intended to allow the compositor one farthing per thousand
  extra for the trouble occasioned by the admixture of italic,
  the frequent occurrence of single letters and monosyllables in
  grammars, spelling books, &c.; but if a compositor be employed on
  a _grammar_ wholly in a foreign language, it is paid no more for
  than if it were a foreign _work_ (see Article III.) It should,
  however, to be consistent, be allowed the halfpenny for foreign,
  and the farthing for grammar, and be cast up at 6½d. with space
  lines, and 6¾d. without space lines.

  “The extra farthing per thousand for this kind of work is not
  to pay for column matter; but two column matter, in grammars,
  spelling-books, &c. is charged not less than one shilling per
  sheet; three and not exceeding four columns are charged one and
  one half; and above four columns are charged double.

  “School Arithmetics, as well as the works above specified, are
  cast up at the above prices.

  “If the works specified above be in smaller type than brevier,
  they take the advance granted for such type in Article I.”

  Art. VI.] “By the words ‘cast up at the usual rate,’ is meant
  works cast up without their extras; and though this article
  specifies small sized works in the English language, the
  principle is applied to foreign works also; and if foreign
  works amount only to the sums specified, they are entitled to
  an advance according to the number of thousands they contain as
  regulated by Art. 3. of the scale. For example, if a foreign
  folio or 8vo. work, in english type, without space lines, contain
  13,000 letters, it would come to 7s. 0½d. Now, as the same
  work in the English language would come to 6s. 6d. and would
  consequently obtain by this Article an advance of 6d., so the
  foreign work is entitled to the like advance, and is paid 7s.
  6d.; if it were not so, the compositor would not receive anything
  for the work being in a foreign language.”

  Art. VII.] “The mere circumstance of a work being a periodical
  publication does not entitle it to the charge of 2s. 6d. per
  sheet. To justify this charge, the text must consist of two
  bodies, and be cast up to their respective founts. Publications,
  however, of more than one sized letter must not be cast up as all
  one body, to avoid the payment of the 2s. 6d. per sheet, but must
  be charged according to the proportion of type they contain, with
  the 2s. 6d. allowed by this article for the bodies.

  “Reprints of this description of work (if more than a sheet) are
  cast up at three farthings per thousand less than the current
  number, but the 2s. 6d. per sheet is charged. No deduction,
  however, is made for printed copy introduced into the current
  numbers of these works.

  “In Reviews, Magazines, &c. where leads are only occasionally
  used, or when used only in a small portion of the publication, no
  deduction is made.

  “Reviews, Magazines, &c. are entitled to the charge for notes,
  although such notes are set up in one of the bodies used in the
  text.

  “All matter pulled in galleys or slips is made up at the expense
  of the employer.”

  Art. VIII.] “Parts of works done in different houses, when
  unequal in their nature, are cast up according to the respective
  merits of the different parts; and if a sheet, or less than a
  sheet, it is considered a job, and cast up at the price specified
  in Art. XX. of the scale.

  “The expression ‘_nearly made up_,’ is indefinite; but in works
  where two-thirds of the matter are made up, one shilling per
  sheet is charged upon the whole.

  “In works of two or more volumes, when the letter of the first
  volume is all made up, and used for the second, no charge can be
  made for making up letter.”

  Art IX.] “This article does not apply to half sheets or sheets
  of double foolscap, double demy, &c. imposed as sixteens, as
  these are cast up and take the extras as octavo. Sixty-fours and
  forty-eights, in whatever type, are paid 2s. 6d. the former, and
  2s. the latter, per sheet, extra.”

  Art X.] “This article allows the employer to give the alteration
  either to the pressman or to the compositor; but it more properly
  belongs to the compositor, and the general practice of the
  trade is for the compositor on the work to make the alteration.
  The article does not apply to cases where a re-imposition or
  transposition of pages is required; in all such cases the
  compositor is entitled to charge his time.”

  Art XI.] “This article is by general acceptation understood to
  mean that, in a quarto or octavo volume, there must be one note
  of twenty lines, or two shorter ones, to constitute any charge,
  and that there must be on an average more than four pages in
  every ten sheets to carry a _higher_ charge than one shilling a
  sheet; that is, in a work of forty 8vo. sheets, more than sixteen
  pages; for a fresh calculation is not made for every ten sheets.
  If, therefore, two notes, or one note of twenty lines, occur
  in an octavo or quarto volume--and two pages or two notes in
  eighteens and smaller-sized works, one shilling per sheet is paid
  for such works throughout.

  “Where the notes exceed the quantity stipulated in the above
  article, an additional sixpence per sheet is charged, until the
  quantity of note entitles the compositor to a further advance,
  when, in order to ascertain what that advance should be, the
  whole of the notes are measured off, and cast up as a distinct
  body, and one shilling per sheet is charged for placing.

  “_For example_--A work of twenty sheets containing eighty
  pages of notes, or four pages in each sheet, is cast up as
  three-fourths pica (the body) and one-fourth long primer (the
  notes), as follows:

                                                         Per sheet.
  Pica, 40 by 40, at 6d. comes to 16s.        ¾ths  =  £ 0  12  0
  Long primer, 50 by 50, at ditto is 20s.     ¼th   =    0   5  0
                                                         --------
          By letters                                     0  17  0
          Making up, or placing notes                    0   1  0
                                                         --------
                                                       £ 0  18  0
                                                         --------

  “The usual rule for the type for notes is two sixes less than
  the text; i. e. English text has Small Pica notes; Small Pica
  text, Bourgeois notes; Long Primer text, Brevier notes; but
  when under this size a proportionally less quantity of note is
  required to constitute the above charges. Thus--If in a work set
  in Small Pica, the notes should be set in Brevier, which is three
  sizes less than the text; the same number of thousands should be
  composed for 1s. per sheet, as would be equivalent to the number
  of thousands contained in the four pages of Bourgeois, i.e. if
  the four pages of Bourgeois contain 10,000 letters, no more than
  that number of brevier should be composed without an increased
  charge.

  “To compensate the compositor for time employed in making up,
  altering references, &c., the notes, although in the same size as
  any type used in the text, take the charge of 1s. per sheet.

  “_Notes upon notes_, when set up in a smaller type than the note,
  are charged according to the rule laid down for notes.”

  Art XII.] “In casting up a work with side-notes, the side-notes
  are not reckoned in the width of the page.

  “Side-notes are cast up as double--that is, the length and
  breadth of the side-notes are taken, multiplied, and the product
  doubled. When the space between the notes do not exceed a
  broad quotation it is reckoned in measuring off the notes. The
  side-note width of the guard line and head lines are reckoned in
  measuring the depth of the notes. The reglets or leads between
  the text and side-note are reckoned in the width of the text,
  when the side-notes are cast up. One shilling per sheet for
  side-notes, in addition to their being cast up as double, is
  allowed for placing.

  “Under-runners from side-notes are reckoned in the side-note, and
  paid 3d. each, in addition.

  “When the bottom notes to law works, &c. are attended with extra
  trouble, in consequence of numerous contractions, an extra is
  paid.”

  Art. XIII.] “The Saxon language is mentioned only in regard to
  the charge of one shilling per sheet, while works wholly done in
  that language seem to have been unintentionally omitted in the
  Scale; they are, however, paid the same as Greek without accents,
  according to Article XIV.

  “The term ‘dead characters’ is extremely indefinite; and the
  charge allowed by this article is not limited to the languages of
  such nations as are extinct, but includes all languages for which
  roman or italic type is not employed, such as Sanskrit and other
  oriental characters; also German, Irish, &c. &c.

  “This article defines only what charge is to be made for Greek,
  Hebrew, Saxon, &c. when introduced in small quantities in various
  parts of a sheet,--such as single words, half lines, or lines. If
  there be one word, and not more than three lines, the charge is
  one shilling for each character, in every sheet in which those
  characters occur: all above three lines is paid according to
  their value, preserving the 1s. per sheet for the first three
  lines. When the quantity of Greek, Hebrew, Saxon, &c. amounts to
  two-thirds, interspersed throughout the sheet, it is paid as all
  Greek, or an equivalent price allowed for the admixture.

  “As it occasionally occurs that words in Greek, &c. are obliged
  to be set up in a different sized fount to the body of the work,
  when such is the case, extra is paid for justification.

  “For the convenience of employers, and that each sheet of a
  work may be paid the same price, it is sometimes the practice
  to ascertain the quantity contained in the work, and put an
  average price upon each sheet. This was not formerly the general
  custom, nor is it, indeed, commendable, since by this mode it
  often happens that the task of setting up that part of a work
  containing the greatest quantity of Greek, &c. falls into the
  hands of those who have had no share of the lighter parts of the
  work, and thus endless and bitter disputes are caused by one
  man being called upon to perform that labour for which another
  has received the reward. The article limits the charge to ‘that
  sheet,’ and therefore a work in which small portions of Greek,
  &c. are introduced, should be charged according to the particular
  quantity in each sheet.”

  Art. XIV.] “By ‘separate accents’ is meant the use of distinct
  accents with kerned letters.

  “The composition of grammars being attended with extra trouble,
  ¼d. per 1000 is allowed for them. Therefore Grammars in Greek,
  Hebrew, &c. take the advance specified in Article V. Thus, a
  Greek grammar without space lines and accents is paid 9d. per
  1000.

  “Jobs in Greek, &c. of one sheet or under are also paid 1d. per
  thousand more than the prices above stated.

  “It has been contended that works in Greek, Hebrew, &c. not being
  common matter, were not intended to be subject to the reduction
  upon reprints; but as the same advantage accrues to a compositor
  upon reprint Greek as upon reprint English, it is just that
  the reduction should be made; and therefore Greek, &c. set up
  from printed copy, is subject to the modification of the Scale
  proposed by the masters in 1816.”

  Art. XV.] “The phrase ‘paid double’ signifies double the price of
  common matter. Although Hebrew with points is alone stated to be
  cast up as half body and half points doubled; yet Syriac, or any
  other language or character with points, is cast up in the same
  manner.

  “Of the mode of casting up a work with points, the following is
  an example:--Supposing the work to be set up in small pica Hebrew
  with nonpareil points, it is cast up as half small pica and half
  nonpareil, that is, each page is charged as if it were a page of
  small pica and a page of nonpareil.

  “Grammars, Dictionaries, &c. in these languages are cast up at
  double the price specified in Article V.

  “This article applies only to works, or where several pages
  appear together. Small quantities of Arabic, Syriac &c. are paid
  according to Article XIII.”

  Art. XVI.] “That is, if the sonnet type be long primer, the
  square of the page is taken as long primer, and the amount which
  the sheet or job would be paid as long primer is doubled.

  “The rule is, however, but little applicable to the present style
  of letter-press music printing, the composition of which is now
  usually paid an _ad valorem_ price, as double the price of sonnet
  type would not pay. Indeed, in music wholly _instrumental_, Art.
  16. would be useless as a guide, as there would be no _sonnet_
  type employed.”

  Art XVII.] “The charge of 2s. per sheet for Index matter does not
  include the charge for columns or tabular; and indexes cast up as
  tabular or table are charged 2s. in addition to what they come to
  by letters.”

  Art. XVIII. “The expression, ‘not including the numbering,’ does
  not mean that the numbers are not to be reckoned in the square of
  the page, but that when the bookseller sends in his copy without
  numbers at the beginning of the article, or with incorrect
  numbers, and the compositor is required to alter them, or put
  in the numbers, he is entitled to make an extra charge for such
  numbering; in other words, 7d. per thousand does not include the
  charge for the trouble occasioned to the compositor by altering
  or marking in the numbers prefixed to the books.

  “If a booksellers’ catalogue only make a sheet, or less than a
  sheet, it is cast up at no more than 7d. per thousand.

  “Booksellers’ lists or advertisements are charged as a job at 7d.
  per thousand when only making a sheet or under; but if done in
  smaller type than brevier, they take the proportionate advance
  specified in Article 1.

  “When notes or remarks in smaller type are inserted in a
  bookseller’s catalogue, they are paid the same as bottom notes.

  “Catalogues in two columns are paid one shilling per sheet for
  columns.

  “The words ‘in whatever language,’ mean that the foreign
  languages, where roman type is used, viz. Latin, Italian, French,
  &c. take no extra charge; but Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, &c. are paid
  according to Article 13.”

  Art. XIX.] “The compositor’s day’s work is reckoned twelve hours;
  if, therefore, business require it, the compositor _on the piece_
  works from 8 till 10 in the evening, and from 6 to 8 in the
  morning, without any extra charge; but if required to come before
  6, or called to work after 10, he immediately claims 1s., because
  he has already worked two hours beyond the ordinary time, without
  any extra charge. Sunday work, for any portion of time _less_
  than six hours, is paid 1s.

  “Compositors on the establishment, when required to work beyond
  the recognised hours, are entitled to charge extra.--See
  _Appendix_.”

  Art. XX.] “Auctioneers’ Catalogues and Particulars, of whatever
  extent, or whether leaded or unleaded, are cast up at 6d. per
  1000; if any smaller type or other extras occur in a catalogue,
  they are paid in the same way as extras upon bookwork. The
  conditions in smaller type, when standing, are paid as an
  ordinary page of the catalogue; but if set up, are charged
  according to the type in which they are set.

  “Jobs are not cast up as sheets or half sheets, but according to
  the number of pages they may contain. They are also subject to
  the regulations in Art. 1.--_‘A thick space,’ &c. see Art._ 1.
  _to the end of that Article_.”

  Art. XXI.] “This article has occasionally been misconstrued; and
  it has been supposed that if any matter be on the third page,
  the compositors ought to charge the job as four pages; this,
  however, is not the case--for, _in jobs_, it requires matter on
  three pages, in order that they may be charged as four. Thus, a
  circular of two pages, printed on the first and third page, is
  only charged as two pages; but if there be matter on the first,
  second, _and_ third, it is charged as four; or if there be matter
  on the first and second, and an indorse on the fourth, it is
  charged as four. This definition will appear correct when it is
  observed that the indefinite article is used in the scale, which
  does not say, constituting _the_ third, but constituting _a_
  third.”

  Art. XXII.] “This article means that ‘common matter’ or
  undisplayed broadsides, when set up in type ‘such as’ is used
  for leases, deeds, &c. are to be charged, if larger than crown,
  the double of common matter, but if on crown or under, to be
  paid one and one-half common matter; and if table, to be paid
  for as double. That this is the true interpretation of this
  article is evident from the introduction of the words ‘whether
  table or common matter,’ which were not in the scale of 1805, and
  which were inserted to prevent more than double being charged
  for broadside tables above the dimensions of crown. In Ireland,
  table broadsides above medium are paid treble; but by the above
  article, however few or numerous the columns may be, the charge
  is to be that of double common matter.”

  Art. XXIII.] “When blank pages at the end of a work are filled up
  on its return from the author with fresh matter, or booksellers’
  lists, or advertisements, the compositor charges the value of the
  matter, deducting the price of the blank, excepting the time for
  making up the blank. Matter driven out by the insertion of leads
  is charged by the compositor, but his time in doing so is not
  chargeable.

  “The compositors on a work are entitled to correct the author’s
  proofs.”

  Art. XXIV.] “In jobs, it is sometimes necessary to put the
  imprint nearly at the extremity of the paper, leaving a large
  blank between the last line and the printer’s name. In all such
  cases, the blank is not cast up, but the job is considered to be
  two lines longer than the last line of matter. Previous to 1805,
  the imprint was not cast up when it had a large blank before it;
  but as the compositor frequently had to set up the imprint, it
  was agreed that he should charge two lines for it.”

As the Scale of 1805 may be useful as an article of reference, I give
it literally from an official copy which has been in my possession
from that time.

SCALEBOARD.

Is that kind of scale commonly sold by some ironmongers in bundles;
and of which, the scabbards for swords are made: the Compositor cuts
it quadrat high, and to his length.--_M._ Till within these last few
years it was supplied by the Printers Joiners in bundles of sixty
sheets each, four feet long, and varying in width from five inches
to ten; it is now supplied in slips quadrat high. In Moxon’s time it
appears to have been used to branch out matter as we use leads at
present, but, as these are so much superior, they have superseded it
in that department; and it is now seldom employed, except in forms
next the crosses, to facilitate the making of register at press, and
in making margin uniform.--_See_ PAPER.

were originally the same with the Sclavonian. There are several

descended from the Scythians who settled in Europe.”--_Astle_. _See_
SERVIEN. RUSSIAN.


SCRIPT.

The name of a class of types, which, as the appellation implies, is
an imitation of writing. The French call it Anglaise.

There is no character connected with our language on which so much
labour has been expended within the last twenty-five years as on
this. The old Scripts were so notoriously stiff and formal, that they
could hardly be said to bear any other resemblance to writing than in
the mere shapes of the letters; these were cast on a square shank,
with all the ascenders and descenders hanging over the body, which is
styled kerned. These kerned letters, having no support, were liable
on pressure to break off, and the fount became so disfigured thereby
that the use of Script was abandoned by almost common consent. In
1815 Messrs. Firmin Didot and Sons introduced a new Script, cut
with great freedom, and cast on a rhomboidal shank, with triangular
blocks having a corresponding angle on one side, and the other two
sides forming a right angle, with which to justify the beginnings and
endings of lines. In order to enable the printer to form complete
words without any apparent junction, a great number of parts of
letters, parts of common words, and double letters, were added to the
regular alphabet; thus encumbering the plan with such a variety of
sorts that it required great care, and was very tedious to compose
correctly.

This plan was very popular on the Continent, and almost universally
adopted; and so much importance was attached to it that Messrs. Didot
and Sons took out an English patent for it, which they attempted
to enforce against the letter founders of this country a few years
afterwards, but which was resisted, and the claim to invention
abandoned.

Since 1820 the English letter founders have produced a variety of
beautiful Scripts of different sizes, but generally a modification of
the French rhomboidal body plan; still the difficulty of composition
remained to a great extent, and materially detracted from its general
utility.

Within the last five years a further improvement has been made by the
introduction of a new square-bodied Script, for which we are also
indebted to French artists, Messrs. Laurent and Deberney, who have
given it the name of Américain, which is so beautifully cut, and
managed, that the effect of the whole, when well worked, is excellent.

The kern, instead of being unsupported, is protected by the shank of
the letter, having two angles thus [Illustration] thrown out at the
head of the two opposite corners of the body, so as to give support
to both ascenders and descenders; the opposite angles of the letters
are cast with a corresponding slope to receive the hanging over
letters without their incurring any danger of riding upon each other.

This plan obviates all the difficulties of the two former ones, and
requires only a pair of common cases. It is easily composed, and
there is not more risk of damage than attends the working of any
other description of delicate type. The sizes of this Script at
present in the trade are, Canon, Two Lines English, Two Lines Pica,
Great Primer, and Pica.

SECTION.

A section, marked thus §, is the division of a discourse, or chapter,
into less parts or portions.--_Murray._ It is also used in printing
as a reference to notes.


SEDITIOUS LIBELS. _See_ LIBELS.


SEMICOLON. _See_ PUNCTUATION.


SERVIEN.

“The alphabets of the nations descended from the Scythians
established in Europe, namely, the Servien, the Russian, the
Sclavonian, and the Bulgarian, are all derived from the Greek. The
Servien letters are called the Cyrillitan characters, from St Cyril,
who converted the Moravians to Christianity; smaller characters were
afterwards introduced, called Glogolitici. The Russian letters are
immediately derived from those used by St. Cyril.”--_Astle._


SET AT RANDOM.

When compositors cannot make up their matter into pages as they
compose it, either by reason of their working in companionship, or
from other causes, they put it in galleys till they can make up; this
is termed _Setting at Random_. When a compositor is obliged to set a
great quantity at random, so that it becomes inconvenient, on account
of the number of galleys it occupies, and the room it takes up on
the cases, he ties it up in moderate-sized pieces and puts it on
page papers under his frame, with a bit of paper stuck in each with
a number, to mark the order; if it be a work in quarto or folio, too
large for page papers, he ties a cord round the matter in each galley
and keeps it on the slices of his slice galley under his frame, till
he makes up.


SET MATTER.

Matter that is composed, but not worked off, whether
it be made up into pages or at random, is called set matter, to
distinguish it from matter for distribution.


SET-OFF SHEETS.

Sheets of waste paper that are used upon the
tympan sheet, to prevent the ink setting-off on the sheets that
are successively printed when the reiteration is working; they are
changed as soon as any setting-off is perceptible. They are slipped
under the points at their edges, and are quickly changed, or turned,
which is always done to economize the use of paper.

Set-off Sheets are also used upon the cylinders of machines that
perfect, for the same purpose.

A sheet of thin paper is interleaved between every impression of
fine work, particularly if it be large heavy paper and large type,
to prevent setting-off in the heap; the work is hung up to dry with
these sheets in, which are taken out by the warehouseman before the
work is piled away, who then knocks them up, folds them in quires,
and takes care of them till they are wanted again by the Pressmen.

Paper for these purposes is supplied by the warehouseman, who gives
for the first waste or spoiled impressions; for the other tissue
paper is generally used, and with care it will last a long time.


SET OUT PAPER.

Counting out the proper quantity by the warehouseman,
to wet--_M._ We now term it _Giving out Paper_, which _see_.


SETS CLEAN. _See_ CLEAN PROOF.


SETS CLOSE. _See_ GET IN.--_M._ The phrase is now used for close
spacing.


SETS FOUL. _See_ FOUL PROOF.--_M._


SETS OFF.

Work that is newly wrought off at the press often sets off,
especially if it be fat beaten with soft ink: for when it comes to
be beaten, or sometimes only hard pressed, by the Bookbinder, the
moist ink spreads and delates itself round about the face of every
letter, and sullies and stains the whole white paper.--_M._ We do not
now include this spreading and delating of the ink in the meaning of
setting off, but use the term only when one printed sheet parts with
some of its ink to the sheet on which it is laid, or in the press,
or in the process of binding, which it will do with large letter,
which requires much ink, or when a book is pressed, or bound, before
the ink is sufficiently dry: the Bookbinder’s hammer is a severe
test; and where a book is required to be bound as soon as printed,
the best plan, perhaps, is to have it cold pressed, which flattens
the impression of the types, and renders it unnecessary to beat so
much as when this mode of proceeding is not adopted. In printing fine
work at press set-off sheets are used to prevent one sheet defacing
another.--_See_ SET-OFF SHEETS.


SET THE ROUNCE.

Fixing the girts so that the Rounce stand in the most advantageous
position to run the carriage in easily.--_M._


SETS UP TO HIMSELF.

When a compositor has received the making-up from a companion, and
has composed the intermediate matter, he has set up to himself; that
is, he has composed the matter that followed his companion’s last
page and preceded the part he commenced with, and has joined the two
parts, so as to enable him to make up. _See_ JOIN, and MAKING-UP, TO
GIVE THE.


SETS WIDE. _See_ DRIVE OUT.--_M._ We now use the term for wide
spacing.


SET UP CLOSE.

When two or more companions are on the same piece of work, and
when any one of them composes all his copy, so that there is none
intermediate between the close of his and the beginning of the
companion’s that follows him, it is said, he has set up close, or, he
has set close up.


SEVENTY-TWOMO.

A sheet of paper folded into seventy-two leaves or one
hundred and forty-four pages is termed seventy-twos or seventy-twomo.


SHANK.

The square metal the face of a letter stands on, is called the
_Shank of a Letter_.--_M._


SHARP IMPRESSION.

This expression is used two ways by printers: some
say it is a sharp impression when much blanket is used, and the
impression of the types on the paper is deep: others hold, and I am
of the opinion, that it is a sharp impression when no more than the
face of the types appears on the paper, with the lines clear and
smooth, and of a full colour, with as little indention as possible on
the paper. Pressmen and their employers should know in which sense
they each use the term, otherwise it may cause a serious mistake in
work, as the two meanings embrace the best as well as the commonest
work.


SHEARS.

Something similar to those used by tailors; they are employed
to cut brass rule, scaleboard, thin reglet, &c. to proper lengths.
The shears best adapted to this purpose have blades short in
proportion to their handles.


SHEEP’S FOOT.

Is all made of iron, with an hammer head at one end,
to drive the ball nails into the ball stocks, and a claw at the
other end, to draw the ball nails out of the ball stocks.--_M._ It
is customary to have one for each press, which in a wooden press is
suspended by the head from two nails driven into the near cheek of
the press, just below the cap. It is a very useful article to the
pressman; but is often applied instead of the mallet and shooting
stick, to tighten or to loosen quoins, though it occasionally makes
a batter by slipping; I do not like to see it used for this purpose.

SHERWIN AND COPE’S PRESS.

[Illustration: Line drawing of the Imperial Press]

The _Imperial Press_. Dr. Lardner thus describes this press:--In
this beautiful and compact machine, the works upon which the power
depends are almost wholly concealed within the head of the press, and
are in themselves extremely few and simple. The leverage connected
with the bar is similar in principle to that of the Stanhope press;
and the distinguishing peculiarity of this press consists in the
manner in which the lever, called the chill, is made to act upon the
piston, as represented in the engraving of the working parts. The
stout cast-iron lever or chill terminates in a sort of polished toe
or point. This last-mentioned projection of the lever is made to act
on a cup or knuckle acting upon the head of a stout iron bolt, which
simply drops down a perforation of the piston, so as to rest upon the
uppermost of two steel wedges, one of which, by its connexion with
a screw in the front, admits of being pushed forward or drawn back,
so as to elevate or lower the bolt, and thus regulate, by altering
the length of the piston, the bearing of the platen upon the types.
The head-bolt passes through a hole perforated somewhat obliquely;
by which ingenious contrivance, a side twist, which would otherwise
be occasioned by the motion of the head gear is avoided. It will now
easily be perceived how, by the operation of the bar, the toe is
made to act upon the inside bolt, and thus force down the piston,
which, after the impression has been taken, is carried back again,
by means of two stout steel springs attached to the insides of the
cheeks of the press, and thus on the return of the bar lift the
platen from the face of the types and allow the carriage with the
form to be run out. These springs, operating uniformly, cause the
action of the piston to be very smooth. The Imperial press, is, I
believe, in high estimation for easiness in the pull, which gives it
speed in working, and for evenness of impression.

On the first introduction of this press the toe of the lever or chill
worked on a flat surface on the top of the bolt; the introduction of
the cup or knuckle is a subsequent improvement.

They are made of different sizes, from foolscap folio to double royal.

[Illustration: Figure showing the Works which produce the Power.]


SHOE.

An old shoe with the hind quarter cut away, hung upon a nail through
the heel at the end of the imposing stone, into which to put bad
letters when correcting. When full, the person who has the care of
the materials empties it into the old metal box.


SHOOTING STICK.

Is a perfect wedge about six inches long, and its thicker end two
inches broad, and an inch and an half thick; and its thin end about
an inch and an half broad, and half an inch thick; made of box
wood.--_M._ They are not now made so thick.

The use of a shooting stick is to drive the quoins with a mallet,
both in locking-up and unlocking a form; they are 8½ inches long.

[Illustration: A wooden Shooting Stick]

As the thin end of a wooden shooting stick always wears down rapidly,
or splits, some houses have adopted metal ones, made of brass, well
secured in a strong wooden handle, with a square piece cut out of
the end, leaving one side a little longer than the other, with a
more acute angle; these are very useful where the quoining room is
small, and the quoins are of course thin.


SHORT CROSS.

_See_ CHASE.--_M._ The shortest and also the broadest bar that
divides a chase into quarters; there is a groove in the upper side
of it to admit the spurs of the points to be pressed into it without
injuring their points. This cross is dovetailed in the middle of the
sides of the chase, for folios, quartos, and octavos, without the
long cross for folios; there is another dovetail in the rim of the
chase, leaving about two thirds of the chase on one side of the short
cross and one third on the other; the cross is fitted into these
dovetails for twelves, and separates the offcut from the other part
of the sheet. I would always place the short cross in the middle
of the chase for eighteens, where the margin will admit it, as it
divides the pages more equally, and makes the form safer when locked
up; in this case the cross occupies the place of a gutter instead of
a back.


SHORT PAGE.

A page that is not full of matter; as the end of a chapter, a book,
or a volume. Though it is termed a short page, yet the term only
applies to what appears when printed, for in reality the page is, or
ought to be, made up to the exact length of the other pages in the
sheet, the blank part being filled up with furniture. I would always
put a lead at the least after the last line of the matter, and next
to that a piece of thick reglet cut to the measure, to prevent any
letters dropping down, and a line of quotations, or large quadrats,
at the bottom, which will keep the other pages in register; the
vacancy between these may then be filled up with furniture to make
the page of a proper length, and if they be not so long as the
exact width of the page it will not be material; but if it be made
up entirely with furniture, the adjoining pages will be twisted and
out of register, when the form is locked up, for it is not possible
to cut the pieces so accurate to the width as a line of quadrats, for
the gutter to rest against. If the page be very short, it will be
better to have an additional line of quadrats or quotations in the
middle.


SHORT PULL.

When the pull is so justified, that a sufficient pressure is produced
when the bar is brought about half way over, or a little more; this
pull is adopted in small light forms, where despatch is required.


SHORT RIBS. _See_ CRAMP IRONS.


SHUFFLING.

This is a term used in the Warehouse; and is part of the process
of Knocking-up, when the paper is laid in heaps, after having been
taken down from the poles, to make it lie even at the edges. It is
performed by taking hold of a few quires of the paper loosely at the
sides, and holding the far side a little lower than that next the
body, upon the table, when, shaking both hands, it gradually projects
the lower sheets; then lifting it up and bending it a little, it is
let drop on its edge upon the table; by repeating this process two or
three times, the parcel becomes even at the edges, and is in a fit
state to be piled away. It is a process in which expertness can only
be acquired by practice, and observation.


SIDE NOTES. _See_ MARGINAL NOTES.


SIDE STICK.

The same as foot stick, except that they are placed against the side
of the page, as their name signifies. _See_ FOOT STICK.


SIGLA.

By this term are meant, notes, breviatures, letters set for words,
characters, short hand.

We find sigla in the most ancient MSS.: some specimens of such as
were used in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries, are here
given. Some of these sigla were made by the Antiquarians who wrote
the book, and others afterwards for the illustration of the text The
annexed sigla may be explained thus:--

[Illustration: The twelve sigla]

   1. H. S. _i. e._ Hic suppleas, or hæc supplenda.
   2. H. D. _i. e._ Hic deficit, or hæc deficiunt.
   3. Paragraphus, a note of division.
   4. Diple, to mark out a quotation from the Old Testament.
   5. Crisimon, being composed of X and P, which stands for Christ.
   6. Hederacei folii Figura, an ivy leaf, the ancient mark of division.
   7. Ancora superior. To denote a very remarkable passage.
   8. Denotes, the beginning of a lesson.
   9. Signifies good.
  10. Stands for something very kind, or benevolent.
  11. Points out a fine or admirable passage.
  12. L. D. _lepide dictum_. Finely said.

Many writers have employed their pens in elucidating the sigla
on coins and medals; among others, Octavius de Strada _in Aurea
Numismata_, &c. where we read C. CÆSAR. DIVI. F. IMP. COS. III. VIR
R. P. C. that is, _Caii Cæsaris Divi filius imperator consul Triumvir
reipublicæ constituendæ_. A number of similar examples may be found
in the same author, and in _Æneas Vicus Parmensis de Augustarum
imaginibus_.

As to epitaphs or sepulchral inscriptions, it was common to begin
them with these literary signs, D. M. S. signifying _Diis Manibus
Sacrum_, and, as still is customary with us, on such occasions, the
glorious actions, praises, origin, age, and rank of the deceased,
with the time of his death, were set forth.

It is a fact too well known to require any particular elucidation,
that it was customary with the ancients to burn the bodies of the
dead, and to deposit the remains in urns or vessels, as appears from
the funeral obsequies of Patroclus and Achilles in Homer.

Altars erected to the Supreme Being are of the highest antiquity, but
by the ambition and corruption of mankind were afterwards prostituted
to flatter both the living and the dead. Inscriptions, or literary
signs, frequently appeared on those altars; as Ar. Don. D. that is,
_Aram dono dedit_, and such like.

Public Statues were erected to Kings, Emperors, and others, both
before and after their death, on which the names of the dedicators
were frequently inscribed in literary signs. As in this inscription,
Civ. Interamnanæ Civ. Utriusque Sex. Aer. Coll. Post Ob. H. P. D.
that is, _Cives Interamnanæ civitatis utriusque sexus ære collato
post obitum hujus patronæ dedicarunt_.

The Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans used forms of saluting or
complimentary expressions at the beginning of their letters, and then
proceeded to the subject of the letters themselves.

The Latin method was to place the name of the writer first,
afterwards that of the person to whom the letter was addressed. The
names were either put simply without any epithet in literary signs,
as C. ATT. S. that is _Cicero Attico Salutem_; or the dignity or
rank of the person was added, as, C. S. D. Planc. Imp. Cos. Des. that
is, _Cicero Salutem dicit Planco Imperatori Consuli designato_. The
epistolary writings of the Romans abound with examples of this kind.

The Military Sigla amongst the Romans are treated of by Vegetius and
Frontinus.

See John Nicholaus, who hath written professedly upon the Sigla of
the Ancients;--J. Nicolai Tractatus de Siglis Veterum. Lugd. Bat.
1703, 4to.

A competent knowledge of these literary signs, or verbal contractions
used by the ancients, is of the utmost importance to those who wish
to be familiarly acquainted with ancient history. These Sigla or
Signs frequently appear on marbles, coins, and medals, and occur in
those inestimable volumes of antiquity, which have transmitted to us
the most important truths relative to the religion, manners, customs,
arts and sciences, of ancient nations. These are keys, as it were,
to unlock the most precious volumes of antiquity; they introduce us
to a more speedy acquaintance with all the various works of ancient
artists and writers. The instruction to be derived from this branch
of polite learning is of itself a sufficient spur to stimulate
attention and industry; but its utility, which is no less obvious, is
an additional incentive to augment our application and desires, when
we consider, that there are no ancient documents, either on metals,
marbles, precious stones, bark, parchment, paper, or other materials,
which do not abound with these literary contractions, and that it
will be very difficult to understand them without this necessary
knowledge.--_Astle._ _See_ RECORDS.


SIGNATURE.

A letter of the alphabet placed at the bottom of the first page of
each sheet of a work, to denote, alphabetically, the order of the
sheets.

It is customary to commence with B on the first sheet of the body
of the work, and to go regularly through the alphabet, with the
exception of the letters J, V, and W, which are never used as
signatures; and which had, in fact, no existence in the alphabet at
the time of the invention of printing; [J] expressing both I and J;
[U], both U and V; and [UU] the double letter W. If the work extend
to more sheets in number than there are letters in the alphabet,
the succeeding sheets go on with a second alphabet, which commences
with A, and both the letters are usually given, in this manner, A
A, or Aa, and sometimes, to avoid the repetition, thus, 2 A; if a
third alphabet be necessary it is always, at the present day, placed
with the number before it, as 3 A. The printer’s first alphabet
consists of twenty-two letters, and the second and succeeding ones of
twenty-three.

As a guide to the bookbinder there are other signatures used in a
sheet besides the first--in a sheet of octavo the first page has B,
the third has B 2, the fifth has B 3, and the seventh has B 4: in a
sheet of twelves they are carried to B 6; B 5 being the first page of
the offcut; and however numerous the pages may be in a sheet with one
signature, when they are all inserted, they are continued to the last
odd page before the middle of the sheet, but never carried beyond
the middle. In general they are all omitted except the two first, to
show the first fold of the paper, and the first on the offcut. Small
capitals are more frequently used for signatures than large capitals,
as disfiguring the foot of the page in a slighter manner.

Sometimes figures are used instead of letters, but not often; the
Gentleman’s Magazine is an instance.

I have extended these tables of Signatures and folios to 18mo., which
is a size that has been much in use of late years; and in the table
of 18mo. I have given it as usually imposed, as three half sheets of
12mo. with three signatures; the first signature in each sheet is
with a capital letter, the intermediate signatures are small capitals.


SIXTEENMO.

--A sheet of paper folded into sixteen leaves or thirty-two pages is
termed a sixteens or sixteenmo.


SIXTY-FOURMO.

--A sheet of paper folded into sixty-four leaves or one hundred and
twenty-eight pages is termed sixty-fours or sixty-fourmo.


SLICE.

--The false bottom of a large galley, made to slide out, for the
purpose of keeping a quarto or a folio page upon it, without
disturbing it, as being safer than transferring it to a page paper.
_See_ GALLEY.

[Illustration: A iron ink scraper, or Slice]

SLICE is also the name of an iron implement used in the ink block to
transfer the ink from the tub or other receptacle, and to scrape it
together in a mass, clear of the balls when ink is taken with them;
it has an iron pin through it near the bottom of the handle, so that
if it falls flat on the ink block, it will rest on this pin, which
prevents the handle from being smeared with ink.


SLIPS.

--In printing encyclopædias, dictionaries of arts or sciences, and
similar works, which frequently undergo great alterations in the
proofs, they are occasionally pulled on slips of paper, of the length
and half the breadth of a demy leaf of paper. This is done on account
of the facility of adding new subject matter, or taking some away,
without having to overrun and to re-make up the sheet, after it has
been imposed in pages.


SLUR--When from any cause at press, the impression on the paper is
smeared, it is said to _Slur_.

This may arise from many causes--if the tympan joints are loose, it
will be produced by the least lateral movement of the tympan after
it is turned down--if the ear of the frisket touches the inside of
the cheek in running in, it will cause it--if the press runs close,
so that the inner tympan touches the face of the platen, it is very
likely to slur; and I have often observed this in wooden presses that
had been altered to obtain the additional power, for the platen was
brought so low and near to the face of the letter in the form, as
not to allow room to run in clear. In presses where the tympans are
large, if the slur pin does not act, that corner of the tympan will
come in contact with the form first, and cause a slur, particularly
if the tympans are in any way rickety, or twisted by drawing on the
parchment. Where the winter has been justified with cards, to produce
a greater spring in the pull, it has been known to produce slurring.
The first step towards curing this defect is to ascertain from what
cause it arises; and then it is not difficult: but it has often
caused great trouble to discover the cause.

The following are my old Pressman’s directions “To prevent Slurring
and Maculing;” and though it will be perceived that some of them
apply only to wooden presses, yet the whole may be useful.

“1. Keep the face of the inner tympan and platen clean and dry.

“2. Be sure that the parchments are tight both on the inner and outer
tympans; also that the tympans are not rickety, nor the joints slack.

“3. Guide cramps are a great preventive to slurring and maculing.

“4. The tenons in the head and winter must exactly fit the mortises
in the cheeks.

“5. The short bolts must be screwed tightly up, to fix the nut or box
firmly in the head, and must not have the least play.

“6. The garter must fit the spindle and hose, and the spindle must
fit the hose, as exactly as possible.

“7. The hose must work perpendicularly, and steady in the shelves.

“8. The platen must be tightly and properly tied, or otherwise fixed,
so that it shall come down upon the face of all the types in the form
at the same moment.

“9. The wheel must be well justified on the spit.

“10. The railing of the inner tympan must not rub against the platen,
in running in or out.

“11. The shanks of the points must not be so far over the outer part
of the tympan as to rub against the cheeks of the press.

“12. If a clumsy smith has made the joints of the frisket so thick as
to cause the tympan to rub against the face of the platen, he must
alter them at his own expense.

“13. The shelves must be quite steady.

“14. The press stone must be worked down with hard pulling until it
becomes a fixture.

“15. The frisket must be quite even, and fall flat on the form; and
the paper which is pasted on it must not bag.

“16. Fix the winter as solid as possible.

“17. Let the tympans fall easily on the form, neither driving them
from you, nor pulling them to you in letting them down; neither let
the platen touch them till they are quite run in, nor run them out
till the platen is quite clear of them.

“Exclusively of the aforesaid, there may be many other causes of
slurring, which the pressman can only discover by close attention. I
have often found cork bearers a great preventive.

“I have heard many complaints of the middle pages of a twelves form
maculing at a two-pull press; but this is not always the fault of
the press. The cause frequently is owing to blankets being in the
tympan which have been used for folios, quartos, octavos, &c. &c.;
and instead of its being a macule, it is nothing more than that part
of the blanket which had covered the short cross of other work, and
in the twelves form caused a deep and ugly impression, looking like a
macule: this evil can only be remedied by new blankets, or confining
the use of them to 12mo. forms.”


SLUR PIN.

--A flat-headed screw, that goes through the off side of the outer
tympan, near the head band, so as to rest on the chase or furniture.
Its use is to prevent the off corner of the tympan from coming down
on the types before the other parts, which when it happens causes
slurring.


SMALL CAPITALS.

--Capitals of a smaller size than the regular capitals of a fount,
but cast on the same body; thus the small capitals of Double Pica are
about the same height as English capitals. They bear off more from
each other, and are stouter, in proportion to their size, than the
capitals of the same fount. They are used for running titles; for
heads of chapters; for emphatic words; and for subordinate lines in
titles and jobs. Till of late years small capitals were only cast in
England to founts of Roman letter; the type founders cast them now
occasionally to Italic letter, and they form a useful sort.

Moxon does not mention small capitals; nor are they in the plan of
the cases of Roman letter which he gives in his work. _See_ SORTS.


SMALL NUMBERS.

--Under 1500 laid on, is accounted a small number. _See_ GREAT
NUMBERS; and _see_ LAY ON.--_M._ We now look on all numbers under 500
to be small numbers.


SMALL PICA.

--The name of a type, one size larger than Long Primer and one
smaller than Pica. It is half the body of Double Pica in depth. Moxon
does not enumerate it in his Table of the sizes of each body; but,
after giving the names of the different types, he says, “These are
the bodies most of use in England; but the Dutch have several other
bodies: which because there is little and almost no perceivable
difference from some of these mentioned, I think they are not worth
naming. Yet we have one body more which is sometimes used in England;
that is a Small Pica, but I account it no great discretion in a
master printer to provide it: because it differs so little from the
Pica, that unless the workmen be carefuller than they sometimes are,
it may be mingled with the Pica, and so the beauty of both founts may
be spoiled.” _See_ TYPES.

This was published in 1683, and opinion has changed so much
respecting this size, that at the present day there are perhaps more
works printed with it than with any other size.


SMOUT.

Workmen when they are out of constant work, do sometimes accept of a
day or two’s work, or a week’s work at another printing house: this
by-work they call _Smouting_.--_M._ In fact we only term it smouting
when the business of a house is slack, or, in other words, when work
is insufficient to employ fully the workmen regularly employed, and
they go to some other house for temporary employment, till such time
as there is sufficient for them in their own house, when they return.


SOAKING PULL. _See_ EASY PULL.--_M._


SOCKETS FOR THE GALLOWS. _See_ GALLOWS SOCKETS.


SOFT INK.

Ink or varnish moderately boiled.--_M._ It is now generally termed
Weak Ink.

The varnish of soft or weak ink is not so strong as that for fine
ink; it does not require so much time and labour to distribute it
on the balls and rollers, and it more readily covers the face of
the type: on these accounts, as well as the expense, it is used for
common work, as it enables the pressman to make more riddance; it is
also used for machine printing, as the rollers passing rapidly over
the forms with their own weight only, are found not competent to coat
the face of the type with strong ink.


SOFT PULL. _See_ EASY PULL.--M.


SOLACE. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.--_M._


SOLID DIG. _See_ BAD WORK.


SOLID MATTER.

Matter that is composed without any leads between the lines, is
termed solid matter; in the scale of prices of 1810 it is designated
‘_without space lines_.’ Previously to that time it was paid the same
price as leaded matter, but then there was an advance allowed on it.
_See_ SCALE.


SOP THE BALLS.

When a pressman has taken too much ink, he is said to sop the
balls.--_M._


SORTS.

The letters that lie in every box of the case are separately called
_Sorts_ in Printers and Founders language; thus, a is a sort, b is a
sort, c is a sort, &c.--_M._

In houses that have more founts than one of the same sized letter,
it would preserve uniformity in the appearance of their work, if
the following sorts were all of the same fount in the same sized
type, particularly in lists of names, indexes, and articles that run
on sorts, as by that means all the sorts in the office might be
brought into use, when necessary, which would frequently be of great
advantage, both for the convenience of the printer and the appearance
of the work: under the present plan, where every fount varies in its
proportions and appearance, the printer, in the before-mentioned
cases, is put to a great inconvenience and expense, or else has to

of this plan would also be of advantage to the type founder.

SOUNDINGS.

When a pressman has got near the bottom of his heap, and, rapping his
knuckles on it, the boards of the horse sound nearly as if he had
struck the wood, he says, he is in soundings.


SPACE LINES,

generally called Leads by printers. Thin pieces of type metal, cast
to different thicknesses, and different lengths, quadrat high, to
put between the lines of matter to make it more open; they are also
used to branch out titles, small jobs, and parts of a work where
necessary.


SPACE RULES.

Fine lines, cast type high, in short thin pieces, to answer the
purpose of brass rule in table work where a number of short pieces of
a precise length are required. Two of them are generally equal to a
pearl body.


SPACING.

The adjustment of the distance between the words in a line, so that
there shall not be any glaring disproportion; also extending a word
or a line of capitals by putting spaces between the letters. _See_
COMPOSING.


SPANISH.

Ñ has a peculiar nasal sound, like the French _gn_: the English
have no sound like it, except in the last four letters of the word
_minion_, which bear some resemblance to the last three of the word
_riñon_, in Spanish: as _niño_, _piña_.

The note of interrogation is not only used at the conclusion of an
interrogatory, but also placed, inverted, at the beginning, in order
to warn the reader, unless the preceding words convey a sufficient
warning; as _¿ Que es lo que vm. acostumbra? preguntó al enfermo._

The note of admiration is also inverted at the beginning of
ejaculations, when the preceding words are not sufficient to prepare
the reader; as _¡ Pastas dulces y viandas suculentas! exclamó
suspenso y admirado el doctor.--M‘Henry’s Grammar._

SPECIMEN PAGE.

When a new work is put in hand, a specimen page, that is, a page
of the proposed size and letter, is composed, and pulled in a neat
manner on paper similar to that which is meant to be used. This is to
show the effect of the work when printed. It sometimes occurs, that
two or three pages are required, of different sizes, and of different
letter, before the author or publisher decides in what way the work
shall be done. These are called Specimen Pages.

If the work be not proceeded with, these specimen pages are charged
by the master printer to his employer; if it goes on, they are
included in the general charge.


SPELLING. _See_ ORTHOGRAPHY.


SPINDLE.

The screw to which the bar of the press is affixed, and which
produces the pressure on the platen.

The upper part of the spindle is round, on which a screw is cut, that
works in the nut fixed in the head; the next part lower is square,
with a square hole in it to receive the end of the bar; the lower
part is round and tapering and goes through the hose, to which it
is attached by the garter, the spindle having a groove cut round
it, into which the two semicircular ends of the garter enter and
encircle it, by which contrivance the platen is raised on the return
of the bar; the lowest end of the spindle is called the toe, which is
hardened steel, and works in the stud of the platen.


SPIRIT.

_See_ DEVIL.--_M._ Every chapel is haunted by a spirit, called Ralph.
When any man resists the decision of the chapel, and it is determined
to enforce it, Ralph, or the spirit, is said to walk; and whatever
mischief is done to the resisting party to enforce submission, which
is always performed secretly, is invariably imputed to Ralph, or the
spirit. _See_ CHAPEL.


SPIT.

The iron spindle on which the drum or wheel and the rounce are fixed,
to run the carriage in and out with. It is square in the middle part,
where the wheel is fixed, and has a square end for the rounce to fit
on: it works in two pieces of iron, screwed to the outsides of the
frame of the wooden ribs.


SPONGE.

Sponge is used both by compositors and pressmen--by compositors,
to wet matter that is tied up previous to distributing it--to wet
matter that is not tied up, to prevent it going into pie--and in
correcting to wet matter, particularly if it be small letter, when it
is necessary to transpose it: by pressmen, to wet their tympans with.


SPOTTISWOODE PRESS.

This is a beautiful contrivance, and was, as I understand, the
invention of Andrew Spottiswoode, Esq., who has several of them in
action in his extensive establishment. It is moved by steam, and
prints two forms at the same time, which pass alternately under
the platen, producing at its average rate of working seven hundred
impressions of each form in the hour.

The frisket is attached to the tympan at the bottom near the tympan
joints, so that when the tympan is lifted from the form by the
machinery they open at the upper end, contrary to the usual way in
presses worked by manual labour, and the printed sheet is left by the
tympan resting on the frisket, where the paper was previously laid on.

I believe this is the first successful application of steam, as a
motive power, to printing presses with a platen and a perpendicular
pressure. I heard the late Alexander Tilloch, Esq., say that he
intended to apply it to the presses with which the Star newspaper was
printed, but he never carried it into effect; and Mr. Koenig came
to England solely for this purpose; but after some years passed in
making experiments, assisted by English capital, he was completely
foiled in the attempt, and afterwards worked upon Mr. Nicholson’s
plan, and produced a machine to print with cylinders.--_See_ MACHINE.


SPRING OF A FORM.

When a form has a great quantity of furniture in it, and is locked up
very tight, it frequently springs up in the middle, so as to endanger
its bursting upward; it is then said, the form springs, or it is
termed the spring of the form.

In this case it is advisable to examine the furniture, for some
pieces may not be planed square by the joiner, and to change them for
others of the same size that appear perfect, and do not lock up very
tight; tighten the quoins gradually, and frequently plane down while
you are locking up; these measures will generally remedy the evil.


SPUR.

The point that pricks the hole in the paper at press, to make
register with.


SQUABBLE.

A page or form is squabbled when the letters of one or more lines are
got into any of the adjacent lines; or that the letter or letters are
twisted about out of their square position.--_M._


STACK OF BOOKS. _See_ PILE OF BOOKS.


STACK OF PAPER.

When paper is received into the warehouse from the stationer, it is
piled up in tiers of four, five, six, or eight bundles in each tier,
and is called a stack of paper, or a pile of paper.

The warehouseman in piling his paper considers the height of his
room, that he may not take up more of the floor than is absolutely
necessary, to enable him to stow as much as possible: thus, if he
receive one hundred reams, and has height, he will make a stack of
six in preference to two or four or five. He crosses the joinings
of the bundles in each tier to bind them together, as a bricklayer
does in building a square pillar; and I have always found the stack
strengthened by laying on every third or fourth tier a number of
stout wrappers spread over the bundles.

Paper should never be stacked without interposing something between
the bottom of it and the floor, to prevent any water that might
accidentally be spilled coming in contact with it, which would
certainly mildew and spoil it if it were not perceived at the first;
and even then it would require a great deal of trouble to prevent it:
where there are not regular stages made, some short pieces of old
poling laid a little distance from each other upon the floor will
answer very well.


STAGE.

A platform raised a few inches from the floor, to pile books or paper
upon, for the purpose of preserving the bottom of the pile from
injury, in case of water being spilt in the warehouse.

Where there are no regular stages in a warehouse, substitutes, which
answer the purpose very well, may be easily provided, by taking an
old paper board, or any pieces of board, and putting three pieces of
an old pole under each of them on which to pile the books.


STAINING OF PAPER.

The master printers of the metropolis, till within a few years, dined
together annually at some good coffee house or tea gardens in the
vicinity of London; and one of the regular toasts after dinner was,
“_The well-staining of Paper_.”


STAMPS.

  3 & 4 W. 4. c. 97. s. 12. It is among other things enacted,
  That * * * * “if any Person shall fraudulently use, join, fix,
  or place for, with, or upon any Vellum, Parchment, or Paper any
  Stamp, Mark, or Impression which shall have been cut, torn, or
  gotten off or removed from any other Vellum, Parchment, or Paper;
  * * * * then and in every such Case every Person so offending,
  and every Person knowingly and wilfully aiding, abetting, or
  assisting any Person in committing any such Offence, and being
  thereof lawfully convicted, shall be adjudged guilty of Felony,
  and shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be
  transported beyond the Seas for Life, or for any term not less
  than seven Years, or to be imprisoned for any Term not exceeding
  four Years nor less than two Years.”


STAND STILL.

A compositor is said to stand still, if he be out of copy, or out of
letter: a pressman, if he has not a form to lay on, or is prevented
working by any other cause. A compositor says he is standing still
for copy, or for letter--a pressman says he is standing still for a
form, &c.


STANHOPE PRESS.

The merits of the Stanhope press, and its superiority, are so well
established in the minds of printers, from long experience of its
valuable properties, that any additional praise from me would be an
act of supererogation; I shall therefore confine myself to giving
engravings of it, and a rather full description.

[Illustration: _Fig._ 1. _Fig._ 2.

_Fig._ 3. _Fig._ 4.]

_Figs._ 1. and 2. are elevations, _fig._ 3. a plan, and _fig._ 4. a
section. A A is a massive frame of cast iron, formed in one piece:
this is the body of the press, in the upper part of which a nut is
fixed for the reception of the screw _b_, and its point operates
upon the upper end of a slider, _d_, which is fitted into a dovetail
groove formed between two vertical bars, _e, e_, of the frame. The
slider has the platen, D D, firmly attached to the lower end of it;
and being accurately fitted between the guides _e, e_, the platen
must rise and fall parallel to itself when the screw, _b_, is turned.
The weight of the platen and slider are counterbalanced by a heavy
weight, E, behind the press, which is suspended from a lever, F, and
this acts upon the slider to lift it up, and keep it always bearing
against the point of the screw. At G G are two projecting pieces,
cast all in one with the main frame, to support the carriage when the
pull is made; to these the rails, H H, are screwed, and placed truly
horizontal for the carriage, I, to run upon them, when it is carried
under the press to receive the impression, or drawn out to remove the
printed sheet. The carriage is moved by the rounce or handle K, with
a spit and leather girths, very similar to the wooden press. Upon
the spit, or axle of the handle K, a wheel, L, is fixed, and round
this leather girths are passed, one extending to the back of the
carriage to draw it in, and the other, which passes round the wheel
in an opposite direction, to draw it out. By this means, when the
handle is turned one way it draws out the carriage, and by reversing
the motion it is carried in. There is likewise a check strap, _f_,
from the wheel down to the wooden base, M M, of the frame, and this
limits the motion of the wheel, and consequently the excursion of the
carriage. The principal improvement of Earl Stanhope’s press consists
in the manner of giving motion to the screw, _b_, of it, which is
not done simply by a bar or lever attached to the screw, but by a
second lever; _e. gr._ the screw, _b_, has a short lever, _g_, fixed
upon the upper end of it, and this communicates by an iron bar, or
link, _h_, to another lever, _i_, of rather shorter radius, which
is fixed upon the upper end of a second spindle, _l_, and to this
the bar or handle, _k_, is fixed. Now when the workman pulls this
handle, he turns round the spindle, _l_, and by the connexion of the
rod, _h_, the screw, _b_, turns with it, and causes the platen to
descend and produce the pressure. But it is not simply this alone,
for the power of the lever, _k_, is transmitted to the screw in a
ratio proportioned to the effect required at the different parts of
the pull; thus at first, when the pressman takes the bar, _k_, it
lies in a direction parallel to the frame, or across the press, and
the short lever, _i_, (being nearly perpendicular thereto,) is also
nearly at right angles to the connecting rod _h_; but the lever, _g_,
of the screw makes a considerable angle with the rod, which therefore
acts upon a shorter radius to turn the screw; because the real power
exerted by any action upon a lever, is not to be considered as acting
with the full length of the lever between its centres, but with the
distance in a perpendicular drawn from the line in which the action
is applied to the centre of the lever. Therefore, when the pressman
first takes the handle, _k_, the lever, _i_, acts with its full
length upon a shorter length of leverage, _g_, on the screw, which
will consequently be turned more rapidly than if the bar itself was
attached to it; but on continuing the pull, the situation of the
levers change, that of the screw, _g_, continually increasing in its
acting length, because it comes nearer to a perpendicular with the
connecting rod, and at the same time the lever, _i_, diminishes its
acting length, because, by the obliquity of the lever, the rod, _h_,
approaches the centre, and the perpendicular distance diminishes; the
bar or handle also comes to a more favourable position for the man
to pull, because he draws nearly at right angles to its length. All
these causes combined have the best effect in producing an immense
pressure, without loss of time; because, in the first instance, the
lever acts with an increased motion upon the screw, and brings the
platen down very quickly upon the paper, but by that time the levers
have assumed such a position as to exert a more powerful action upon
each other, and this action continues to increase as the bar is drawn
forwards, until the lever, _i_, and the connecting rod are brought
nearly into a straight line, and then the power is immensely great,
and capable of producing any requisite pressure which the parts of
the press will sustain without yielding. The handle is sometimes made
to come to rest against a stop, which prevents it moving further,
and therefore regulates the degree of pressure given upon the work;
but to give the means of increasing or diminishing this pressure for
different kinds of work, the stop is made moveable to a small extent.
Another plan is adopted by some makers of the Stanhope press, viz.
to have a screw adjustment at the end of the connecting rod, _h_,
by which it can be shortened; it is done by fitting the centre pin
which unites it to the lever, _g_, in a bearing piece, which slides
in a groove formed in the rod, and is regulated by the screw. This
shortening of the connecting rod produces a greater or less descent
of the platen, when the handle is brought to the stop.

The carriage of the press is represented with wheels, m, m, beneath,
to take off the friction of moving upon the ribs, HH. These wheels
are shown at _fig._ 4., which is a section of the screw and the
platen, with the carriage beneath it: their axles, _n_, are fitted to
springs, _p_, and these are adjustable by means of screws, _r_, so
that the carriage will be borne up to any required height. This is so
regulated, that when the carriage is run into the press, its lower
surface shall bear lightly upon the solid cheeks, G, which are part
of the body of the press, and these support it when the pressure is
applied, the same as the winter of the old press: but the wheels by
their springs act to bear up great part of the weight of the carriage
with the types upon it, and diminish the friction, yet do not destroy
the contact of the carriage upon the ribs, because this would not
give the carriage that solidity of bearing which is requisite for
resisting the pull. This is only at the time when the carriage is
run into the press, because as it runs out, the ribs on which the
wheels run rise higher, and therefore the wheels support the whole
weight. The manner in which the wheels run in rebates or recesses
in the edges of the ribs is shown at _fig_. 1. The carriage is made
of cast iron, in the form of a box, with several cross partitions,
which are all cast in one piece, and although made of thin metal, are
exceedingly strong: the upper surface is made truly flat, by turning
it in a lathe. The same of the platen, which is likewise a shallow
box: the slider, _d_, has a plate formed on the lower end of it,
which is fixed by four screws upon the top of the platen, and thus
they are united. At the four angles of the carriage, pieces of iron
are screwed on, to form bearings for the quoins or wedges which are
driven in to fasten the form of types upon it in the true position
for printing. The tympan, P, (_fig._ 2.) is attached to the carriage
by joints, with an iron bracket or stop to catch it when it is thrown
back: the frisket, R, is joined to the tympan, and when opened out,
rests against a frame suspended from the ceiling. The register
points are the same as in the wooden press, and all the operations
of working are exactly the same. The iron frame, A, of the press is
screwed down upon the wooden base, M, by bolts, which pass through
feet, _s s_, projecting from the lower part of the iron frame.
Another wooden beam is fixed into the former at right angles, so as
to form a cross, which lies upon the floor. The ribs, H, for the
carriage to run upon are supported from the wooden base by an iron
bracket, T.

The advantages of the iron presses in working are very considerable,
both in saving labour and time. The first arises from the beautiful
contrivance of the levers, the power of the press being almost
incalculable at the moment of producing the impression; and this is
not attended with a correspondent loss of time, as is the case in
all other mechanical powers, because the power is only exerted at
the moment of pressure, being before that adapted to bring down the
platen as quickly as possible. This great power of the press admits
of a saving of time, by printing the whole sheet of paper at one
pull, the platen being made sufficiently large for that purpose;
whereas, in the old press, the platen is only half the size of the
sheet. In the Stanhope press, the whole surface is printed at once,
with far less power upon the handle than the old press. This arises
not only from the levers, but from the iron framing of the press,
which will not admit of any yielding, as the wood always does, and
indeed is intended to do, the head being packed up with elastic
substances, such as scaleboard, pasteboard, and the felt of an old
hat. In this case much power is lost, for in an elastic press the
pressure is gained by screwing or straining the parts up to a certain
degree of tension, and the effort to return produces the pressure:
now in this case, the handle will make a considerable effort to
return, which, though it is in reality giving back to the workman a
portion of the power he exerted on the press, is only an additional
labour, as it obliges him to bear the strain a longer time than he
otherwise would. The iron presses have very little elasticity, and
those who use them find it advantageous to diminish the thickness of
the blankets in the tympan; the lever has then very little tendency
to return; in fact, if the pull be so justified as that, when the
bar is pulled home, the end of the lever, _i_, that is attached to
the connecting rod, _h_, passes in a small degree the centre of the
second spindle, _l_, the pressure is past its maximum power, the
press bar has no tendency to return, and the pressman can rest upon
his pull in fine work, without any exertion.

STEM.

--The straight flat strokes of a straight letter is called stem.--_M._


STEREOTYPE.

--The surface of a page of types cast in one piece, of type metal,
about the eighth of an inch thick, and turned in a lathe at the back
of the plate, so that the whole of the plates of a volume shall be of
one uniform thickness.

When they are required to be printed they are mounted on what are
called Risers: these risers, with the thickness of the stereotype
plate, are precisely the same height as the types, so that when a
form is composed of stereotype plates and types, the pressure shall
be equal on both.--_See_ RISERS.

The spaces and quadrats are cast higher than for the common
process; and when the form is ready, the face of it is oiled with
a brush, then burnt plaster of Paris (gypsum) mixed with water to
the consistence of cream is poured upon it; when the plaster is
sufficiently hardened it is taken off from the types and forms a
matrix in which to cast a facsimile of the types; this matrix is then
placed in an oven to dry, and made hot, when it is secured in a frame
and immersed in a caldron of melted metal, where it remains some
time; when it is taken out, and cool, it goes to a person styled the
Picker, to remove any superfluous metal, and to remedy any defects;
it is then, generally, turned at the back to a specific thickness,
and to remove any inequalities; after this it is ready for press. For
the details of the process I refer the reader to “An Essay on the
Origin and Progress of Stereotype Printing: including a Description
of the various Processes. By Thomas Hodgson, Newcastle: printed by
and for S. Hodgson, &c. 1820.”

This process was first practised by William Ged, of Edinburgh, who
commenced in the year 1725. After much perseverance he formed an
engagement with the University of Cambridge to print Bibles and
Prayer-books; but the plan received so much opposition from the
workmen, in making errors and batters, that it was discontinued, and
the plates were ultimately sent to Mr. Caslon’s foundery to be melted
down. Mr. Hansard, in his Typographia says,--“But a remnant escaped
from Caslon’s cormorant crucible; and I have the opportunity of here
presenting my readers with an opposite view of a pair of the very
malefactors; and challenge any other to dispute the palm of venerable
antiquity with them: they have been rather roughly treated, but
besides the purpose for which they are here exhibited, will serve to
show the style of type, typography, and stereotype of those days.”

Mr. Tilloch had a page of Ged’s casting given to him by Mr. Murray,
of Fleet Street, bookseller, which I have seen: there is also a plate
of Ged’s casting, at the Royal Institution, containing fourteen
pages of a Common Prayer, presented by Mr. Frederick Kanmacher,
of Apothecaries Hall, from which I had impressions printed.--See

STET.

When a word has been struck out, in reading a proof, and it is
afterwards decided that it shall remain, then it is usual to make
dots under the word which has had the pen run through it and write
the word _stet_ opposite to it in the margin, which is the third

STOLEN PROPERTY.

The Act of the 25th of Geo. II. c. 36. s. 1. inflicted a penalty
of fifty pounds upon any person who should print or publish any
advertisement offering a reward for the recovery of any property
that had been stolen and no questions asked; this section has been
repealed by the Act of the 7 & 8 Geo. IV. c. 27., one of Mr. Peel’s
Acts; and by another of Mr. Peel’s Acts, of the 7 & 8 Geo. IV. c.
29. s. 59., it is re-enacted, with some verbal alterations and the
addition of the words “or lost,” as may be perceived by the following
extract, which it is of importance for printers to be acquainted
with.

  s. 59. “That if any Person shall publicly advertise a Reward for
  the Return of any Property whatsoever, which shall have been
  stolen or lost, and shall in such Advertisement use any Words
  purporting that no Questions will be asked, or shall make use of
  any Words in any public Advertisements purporting that a Reward
  will be given or paid for any Property which shall have been
  stolen or lost, without seizing or making any Enquiry after the
  Person producing such Property, or shall promise or offer in any
  such public Advertisement to return to any Pawnbroker or other
  Person who may have bought or advanced Money by Way of Loan upon
  any Property stolen or lost, the Money so paid or advanced, or
  any other Sum of Money or Reward for the Return of such Property,
  or if any Person shall print or publish any such Advertisement,
  in any of the above Cases, every such Person shall forfeit the
  Sum of Fifty Pounds for every such Offence, to any Person who
  will sue for the same by Action of Debt, to be recovered with
  full Costs of Suit.”

  s. 69. By this section it is enacted, “That it shall be lawful
  for the King’s Majesty to extend his Royal Mercy to any Person
  imprisoned by virtue of this Act, although he shall be imprisoned
  for Nonpayment of Money to some Party other than the Crown.”

STRONG INK.

Ink made with a powerfully binding varnish, so as to prevent the
separation of the colouring matter and the spread of the varnish in
the paper. It is usually made with superior colouring materials, and
more care taken in grinding it than with common ink. _See_ ENGRAVINGS

altering or repairing.


SUMMER.

In a press, a piece of wood nailed across the wooden ribs on the
under side, close to the winter, to keep them steady in their place.

In Moxon’s time a summer was for a different purpose; viz. to
prevent the cheeks of the press from springing open; the winter was
dovetailed into the cheeks, to answer this purpose: after describing
the winter, he adds--

“But yet I think it very convenient to have a _Summer_ also, the more
firmly and surer to keep the cheeks together; this _Summer_ is only
a Rail _Tennanted_, and let into Mortesses made in the inside of the
_Cheeks_, and Screwed to them with long Screws, similar to those used
for _Bed-Posts_; its depth four Inches and an half, and its breadth
eight Inches, _viz._ the breadth of the _Cheeks_.”

SUPERIORS.

Superiors are small letters and figures, upon the upper part of the
shank of the body, so that they range with the top of the letter to
which they belong; as, ^{abcdefgh}, ^{1234567890}; they are generally
used as references to notes, and occasionally in abbreviated words;
as M^r, Master; M^{rs}, Mistress; D^o, Ditto; N^o, (Numero,) for
Number, and in many other instances; also in contracted words, in the
printed Records. _See_ RECORDS. REFERENCES. It would be a convenience
if the type founders would cast the , ; : and . to them, as it has
not a good appearance, when a point is necessary, to see a comma or
any other point used that has been cast for the regular body; it is
too large, and does not range in line.

SWASH LETTERS.

In the seventeenth century Italick capitals, in which some of the
letters had their terminations projecting considerably beyond the
shank, were in use: this projection was called a swash; as--

The order they here stand in is that of the Swedish Alphabet.

  * These letters in the Roman characters are Ä and Ö.

The Swedish language has no diphthongs. When two vowels occur
together, they must both be heard, as _bēēdiga_, brōār.--_Brunnmark’s
Swedish Grammar_. London, 1805.


SWEEPINGS.

When the boys sweep the composing room in a morning, all the letters
and spaces that are on the floor in each frame are carefully gathered
up and placed on the bulk belonging to it, and it is the customary
rule for the compositor to distribute them the first thing; what are
swept together from the middle of the room are collected from the
dust before it is taken away, and put in some appointed place for the
person who has the care of the materials to distribute.

The first and most ancient of these, called Estranghelo, is formed
with square rectangular characters; another alphabet, a little
smaller, has letters slightly differing from the first, for greater
facility in writing; the third is that known generally by the name of
Syriac, and is the only one existing in type in England. The Syriac
reads from right to left.

Olaph, when followed by Lomad, is written obliquely, as ܐܰܠܗܳܐܳ‎. But
when Lomad is followed by Olaph, it is written in the beginning of
words thus, ܠܐܳ‎ _not_; in the middle thus, ܓܷܠܿܓ‎ _he is bewailed_;
and at the end thus, ܓܰܠܠ‎ _it rolls_.

The pronunciation of the letters is the same as in Hebrew and
Chaldee; yet it may be observed, (1.) that Olaph, in certain cases,
takes the sound of Jud, as, ܐܳܐܰܪ‎ ojar _air_, ܡܠܵܐܐܵ‎ mlojo
_fulness_, ܣܐܷܵܡ‎ sojem _placing_; (2.) that Vau initial is to be
pronounced ܠܷܗܲܕ‎ as the consonant _v_, but when medial or final, as
the vowel _u_; (3.) that initial Jud with Chebhozo is pronounced as
_i_, as, ܝܻܠܷܦ‎ ileph _he learned_; (4.) that Ngae followed by He has
the sound of ܐܷ‎, as, ܠܷܗܲܕ‎ ehadh _he remembered_; and (5.) that the
aspirated sibilant Schin has no peculiar point by which it may be
distinguished from the simple sibilant Sin.

The numbers are expressed by the same letters as in Hebrew, excepting
that ܝܗ‎ denotes 15, ܩ‎ 20, and ܢ‎ 50. A point above the line is used
to convert the tens into hundreds, as ܝܿ‎ 100, ܟܿ‎ 200, ܠܿ‎ 300, &c.,
although the four first hundreds may be expressed also by the four
last letters of the alphabet. An oblique line, slanting to the right,
under the first nine letters, serves to denote thousands, as ܐ݈‎
‎1000, ܒ݈‎ 2000; and a similar line, but transverse, designates the
tens of thousands, as ܐ̱‎ 10,000, ‎ܒ̱‎ 20,000.

The vowels are five in number, which are represented either by
figures or by points, according as the ancient or modern system is
followed, but very frequently both are met with together. The simple
vowels are--

  _A_   _E_   _I_   _O_   _U_
  ‎ ‏ܐܰ‎     ‏ܐܷ‎     ‏ܐܻ‎     ‏ܐܳ‎    ‏ܐܘܶ‎

and both figures and points are joined with consonants in the
following manner:--

  Petocho ‏ܒܰ‎ or ‏ܒܲ‎ _ba_.

  Rebhozo ‏ܒܷ‎ or ‏ܒܸ‎ or ‏ܒֽܸ‎ _be_.

  Chebhozo ‏ܒܻ‎  or ‏ܒܹ‎ _bi_.

  Zekopho ‏ܒܳ‎ or ‏ܒܵ‎ _bo_.

  Ozozo ‏ܒܘܽ‎ or ‏ܒܘܿ‎ or ‏ܒܘܼ‎ _bu_.

Formerly the marks for the vowels _E_ and _I_ were only written below
the line, as ‏ܒܷ‎ _be_ and ‏ܒܻ‎ _bi_; and the vowels _A_, _O_, and
_U_, were only written above, as ‏ܒܰ‎ _ba_, ‏ܒܳ‎ _bo_, ‏ܒܽ‎ _bu_;
but now they are placed sometimes above and sometimes below, as may
be most convenient in writing. The points never change their places.

Zekopho does not give precisely the sound of _o_, but an obscure
sound between _o_ and _a_, as we find in 1 Cor. xvi. 22. ‏ܡܓܳܪܰܢ
‎ܐܳܬܐ‎ _Maran-atha_, and in Mark xiv. 36. ‏ܐܰܒܳܐ‎ _Abba_.

Ozozo is never written without Vau (‏ܘ‎), except in ‏ܒܽܠ‎ _all_, and
‎‎‏ܡܷܓܛܾܠ‎ _because of_.

When the point Ozozo is above the line, it denotes Kibbutz; but when
below the line, Shurek.

The diphthongs are formed by the combination of the vowels with the
points, of which these are the most used, ‏ܓܰܘ‎ _au_, ‏ܓܰܝ‎ _ai_,
‎‏ܓܳܝ‎ _oi_, ‎‏‎ܘܳ‎ _ou_.

The vowel marks are not always annexed to the letters to which they
belong, but sometimes to the preceding or subsequent letter, and
sometimes omitted altogether, so that grammatical analogy must always
be attended to by the reader, as, for example, in the word ‏ܒܰܢܝܓܳ‎
_of a son_, the point ‏ܒܰ‎ does not belong to the ‏ܒ‎ over which it
is placed, but to the ‎‏ܢ‎ following.

Three letters (‏ܐ ܘ ܝ‎) become quiescent under certain circumstances.
Olaph, with the vowels Petocho, Rebhozo, and Zekopho
in the middle and at the end of a word; with Chebhozo only at the
end. Vau always with Ozozo, and in foreign names also with Zekopho.
Lastly, Jud with Rebhozo and Chebhozo.

Olaph never allows of sheva before it, but brings its own vowel into
its place, and in that case becomes quiescent.

The vowels are doubtful as respects their quantity, and at one time
are short, and at another long; the difference is to be traced from
analogy.

There are also two points, called Kuschoï and Ruchoch, used for
showing the peculiar power of certain letters, and generally
distinguished in manuscripts by a difference in the colour of the
ink. Kuschoï is a point placed above the six letters ‏ܒ݁ ܓ݁ ܕ݁ ܟ݁
‎ܦ݁ ܬ݁‎ _begadcephat_. It answers to the dagesh in Hebrew, and takes
away the aspiration properly belonging to those letters; thus ‏ܒ݁‎
is equivalent to _b_, ‏ܓ݁‎ to _g_, ‎‏ܕ݁‎ to _d_, ‏ܟ݁‎ to _k_, ‎‏ܦ݁‎
to _p_, ‏ܬ݁‎ to _t_, also to _bb_, _gg_, _dd_, _kk_, _pp_, _tt_.
Ruchoch is a point placed below the six letters ‏ܒ݂ ܓ݂ ܕ݂ ܟ݂ ܦ݂ ܬ݂‎
_begadcephat_; it shows that the letters are to be aspirated, and
answers to the Hebrew raphe; thus ‏ܒ݂‎ is equivalent to _bh_, ‏ܓ݂‎ to
_gh_, ‏ܕ݂‎ to _dh_, ‏ܟ݂‎ to the Greek χ, ‏ܦ݂‎ to φ, ‏ܬ݂‎ to θ. These
points are rarely expressed, unless where there is an ambiguity to be
explained.

Besides those before spoken of, certain lines or points are also
employed, having a use partly in orthography, and partly in
etymology. To orthography belong--

1. A small transverse line written above combined numbers, or
contracted words, as ‏ܝ̅ܗ‎ 15, ‏ܬܫܟ̅ܘ‎ for ‏ܬܫܟܘܽܝܛܐܵ‎ _praise_.

2. A similar small line, called _virgula occultans_, under certain
letters, which, when indicated thus, are of no value, and to be
passed over in reading, so as scarcely to be heard in pronunciation.
Thus ‏ܩܳܪܐ ܐ̱ܙܵܐ‎ is not pronounced _kore ano_, but _koreno_; and
‎‏ܐܳܡܪ ܐ̱ܙܵܐ‎ not _omar ano_, but _omarno_. Olaph, Dolath, He, Lomad,
Nun, and Risch, are the letters most subject to its influence.

3. A diacritical point, changed in its situation in order to avoid
an ambiguity in reading. The following may be taken as cases of this
sort:--

  ‎‏ܒܝܿܫܐ‎ בַיְשָׁא‎ _miserable_.        ‏ܒܝܼܫܐ‎ בִישָׁא‎ _evil_.

  ‎‏ܒܿܟܝܐ‎ בָכְּיָּא‎ _weeping_ (part.).  ‏ܒܼܟܝܐ‎ בֶכְיָא‎ _weeping_ (subs.).

  ‎‏ܕܟܙܿܐ‎ דְיָנָא‎ _a judge_.          ‏ܕܟܙܼܐ‎ דִינָא‎ _judgment_.

The following belong to etymology:--

1. Two points are used to distinguish the numbers of nouns, because
there is often no variation of case or of termination, or mutation
of letters, to distinguish the singular from the plural. These two
points are called Ribbui, _multitude_, and are placed over the
letter, similarly to the Hebrew tzeri, in this manner ‏ܒ̈‎. But if
Risch (‏ܪ‎), which always has a point above it, to distinguish it
from the Dolath (‏ܕ‎), should occur in the word, then the single
point of Risch coalesces with the double point thus, ‏ܩܲܩܪ̈ܐ‎. In the
verbs, the double point indicates the feminine third person plural of
the preterites.

2. A point is placed beneath the line in all the persons of the
preterite (excepting the first person singular, where it is placed
above), and besides this, the third person singular has another at
the left side.

3. The present active participle has a point above the line, but when
Vau is in the middle of the word, the point is placed below.

4. The infinitive and imperative often have a point placed beneath
them, but this is not regular.

5. The second and third persons of the future have a point below the
line, but the first person has the point above.

6. The imperatives of all the passives require the virgula under the
second vowel.

There are no accents expressed in Syriac. The stress in pronunciation
ought to be laid on the last or penultimate syllables; and in this
respect the analogy of the Chaldee is to be attended to.

In the derivation of words from the Hebrew, letters may frequently
undergo mutation with others of the same class, or of the same organ,
and also sibilants with linguals.

The servile letters are eleven in number, as in Hebrew, and are the
same, saving that Dolath is servile, and on the other hand Schin is
radical.

The preceding observations are extracted from Gaspar Waser’s
Grammatica Syra, Leyden, 1619, and from Jacob Alting’s Synopsis
Institutionum Chaldæarum et Syrarum, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1717.

of ink to distribute on the two balls.--_M._ It is equally termed
Taking Ink when rollers are used.

Taking the sheets from the poles with a peel when they are dry.


TAKE-OFF. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS; also FLY. Boys are employed in
machine printing to take away the sheets as they are printed, and to
lay them straight and even; this is also styled Taking-off, and the
boys taking-off boys.


TAKE UP.

To take letters up with a composing rule to distribute.--_M._ When
a compositor is distributing, he places his composing rule against
the head of the matter he means to take up, and putting the sides
of his two third fingers, near the ends, to the ends of the rule,
and the sides of his fingers against the sides of the matter, with
his fore fingers at the extreme end, round the corners of the matter
he intends to take up, and the ends of his thumbs against the back
of the rule, he thus grasps it, and then generally tries if it will
lift, when by a sudden lifting of the bottom end of the matter, and
turning up of the rule with his thumbs, he raises it from the board
to a perpendicular direction, resting on the rule; and turning it
with the face of the letter to him, with one part of the rule resting
on the third finger of his left hand, and the other end against the
ball of his thumb, while the sides of the matter are guarded by his
thumb and forefinger, when the measure is not too wide, he begins to
distribute.

In like manner he takes up matter to move from one galley to another,
when he is making up; except that he places his rule against the
foot of the matter, and when he grasps it he does not raise it
perpendicularly, but lifts it to him under his hands, his forefinger
being against the rule, and his thumbs grasping the head of the
matter.

A stranger to the business would be surprised to see the number of
lines of types that an expert compositor will lift in this manner.


TAKE UP A SHEET. _See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.--_M._ It appears that in
Moxon’s time the compositor had a copy of each work he was engaged
on, or received what was termed copy money in lieu of it. This custom
is abolished; and no workman is permitted to take a copy of any thing
that is printed in the house as a matter of right.


TAKING COPY.

A compositor receiving copy from the overseer, or other person who
has the charge of it, to compose; if in a companionship, the clicker
receives it, and gives it out to the companions.


TAKING OFF.

Part of a page taken up to distribute.--_M._ Obsolete.

க--As a medial, this letter has, when single, the sound of _gh_; when
double, of _kk_. As an initial also it represents _gh_ in certain
words derived from the Sanscrit.

ச--This letter has, when single, the sound of _s_, _sh_, and the
French _g_ in _âge_; when double, it has the sound of _ch_. In words
of Sanscrit origin, it represents the _ja_ and _cha_ of the Sanscrit
alphabet.

த--This letter, when combined with [#], has the sound of the French
_n_ in _Ange_.

ட--This letter has, when single, the sound of _d_; when double, of
_tt_, with a strong cerebral articulation.

த--As a medial, this letter has, when single, the sound of _d_; when
double of _tt_. As an initial, also, it represents _d_ in certain
words of Sanscrit origin.

ந--This is the initial _n_. It is medial only before த.

ப--As a medial, this letter has, when single, the sound of _b_; when
double, of _pp_. And in certain words of Sanscrit origin it has, as
an initial also, the sound of _b_.

ழ--This letter is articulated somewhat like the hard ṛ of the
Hindustani alphabet. It may be said to possess generally as a medial,
the sound of _r_, and as a final, that of _l_, with a cerebral
articulation.

ற--This letter has, when single, the sound of _rr_; and, when double,
the sound of a _double tt_.

The word “soul,” is used metaphorically in Tamul for a vowel; the
word “body,” for a consonant; and the compound word “soul and body,”
for a syllable. In the same metaphorical language, a consonant is
termed “a dead letter.”

It will be seen, in the foregoing scheme, that when the short vowel
_a_ is employed to give utterance, or (to adopt the metaphor of the
Tamul grammarians) _animation_ to the consonants, no additional
character is required; it being considered to be inherent in each
consonant, as essential to its original articulation. The removal of
this originally inherent vowel is usually denoted by a dot or a small
circle placed over the consonant, as ன் (_n_), ர் (_r_).

In the elegant dialect, a character written thus ஃ, and termed
_āyadam_, is used in addition to the ordinary letters of the
alphabet. It is not, strictly speaking, either a vowel or a
consonant; but it has the power of a consonant; it is pronounced
gutturally, and it lengthens the preceding syllable if short by
nature: as இஃது (_ighdu_) “this,” instead of இது (_idu_).

இ before the cerebrals, viz. ட, ண, ழ, ள, ற, has an obscure sound,
best expressed by a short _u_, and may be considered as nearly lost.

ஈ before the cerebrals, possesses nearly the sound of long _u_,
though a practised ear distinguishes a peculiarity in its utterance.

In Tamul, a measure of time, termed _māttirei_, which is described
as occupying the period of the twinkling of an eye, or the snap of
a finger, is assigned to the letters in the manner following; viz.
to a consonant is assigned half a measure; to a short vowel, one
measure; and to a long vowel, two measures.

The character [#] is the consonant _s_ of the Grandonic alphabet.

alphabet are employed, as in Greek and Latin, to express numerical
value.

TAYLOR AND MARTINEAU’S PRESS.

This is an iron press, the frame of which forms two upright cheeks
and the head. The power is not obtained by a screw, but by a cylinder
with a knee-joint in the middle, which is bent when not pulling; this
allows the platen to rise from the form, which is accomplished by a
weight behind, that counter-balances the platen. The pull is effected
by a bar, in the usual manner, that brings the knee-joint straight,
depresses the platen, and produces the impression. The power is
regulated by a screw through the head, that acts upon the cylinder.


TEASE WOOL, or HAIR.

Teasing the hard and almost matted knots in the wool, or hair, with
which the balls are stuffed.--_M_. Wool only is now used for stuffing
balls, which is combed with strong wool combs, previous to knocking
up balls. It appears by this extract, that hair was used for this
purpose as well as wool in the seventeenth century.

THICK SPACE.

A space, three of which are equal to the body of the letter to which
it belongs; it is the thickest space that is cast, the next in
thickness being the en quadrat.


THIN SPACE

ought, by a strict orderly and methodical measure, to be made of the
thickness of the seventh part of the body, though Founders make them
indifferently thicker or thinner.--_M_. Six thin spaces are now equal
to the body.


THIRTY-SIXMO.

A sheet of paper folded into thirty-six leaves, seventy-two pages, is
termed thirty-sixmo.


THIRTY-TWOMO.

A sheet of paper folded into thirty-two leaves, sixty-four pages, is
termed thirty-twomo.


THROW.

Both compositors and pressmen, when they gamble in the office, or
take a chance for any advantage arising in work, generally _throw
for it_; that is, they take nine em quadrats, usually English, and,
shaking them well together in the hollow of both their hands, throw
them upon the imposing stone, or press stone, and he who throws most
nicks upward in three times is the winner. They choose quadrats with
three deep nicks in each, when such a fount is in the office, as
being most easily distinguished.


THUMB PIECE. _See_ EAR OF THE FRISKET.


TIGHTENING THE QUOINS.

This is necessary, particularly in summer time, as also with forms
that are placed contiguous to the fire in winter, to prevent the
matter from falling out. Examining the forms occasionally that have
been some time in chase should not be neglected; for if they have
been imposed when the furniture was wet, the matter is very likely to
fall out, from the gutters and other pieces shrinking. The quoins are
generally tightened with an old cross bar, with the fire poker, or
the claw end of a sheep’s foot, as being heavier and more efficacious
than a piece of light furniture; but the best method, after securing
them in this manner, is to lay them upon the imposing stone, plane
them down, and then lock them up afresh in a regular manner. _See_
FALLING OUT.


TILL, or SHELF.

A mahogany shelf, in wooden presses, divided in two longitudinally,
that clasps the hose, and causes it and the spindle to come down
perpendicularly without any play. It is dovetailed at both ends, and
fits into the cheeks, with block wedges underneath to keep it up
in its situation; the dovetails also keep the cheeks together, and
answer the same purpose that the summer formerly did. The opening
that the hose works in is lined with brass, and is made to fit it
accurately.


TITHES COMMUTATION.

  Direction of the Commissioners or any Assistant Commissioner,
  or by any Tithe Owner or Land Owner, in the _London Gazette_,
  or in any Newspaper, for the Purpose of carrying into effect
  any Provision of this Act, and no Agreement, Award, or Power
  of Attorney made or confirmed or used under this Act, shall be
  chargeable with any Stamp Duty.”


TOE OF THE SPINDLE.

The very bottom of the spindle.--_M_. It is of hardened steel, and
works in the platen stud.


TOKEN.

Ten quires of paper.--_M_. It is now ten quires eighteen sheets, or
half a ream of perfect paper, and contains 258 sheets. All paper for
book work is given out in tokens to wet, the quires in each token
are placed the same way, and the tokens arranged one upon the other,
back and fore edge, for the person who has to wet the paper to take
away. It has become a practice in many houses, for the warehouseman
to give out the paper in tokens alternately of ten quires and a half
and eleven quires; this in my opinion should never be done, for I
have known many serious mistakes arise from it; for instance, in a
book that is a long number, a pressman who is working a sheet, will
borrow a token of paper from another sheet, or three or five, or
more, on account of being in better condition, or for some other
cause; he takes the tokens indiscriminately as they arise, and they
are replaced in the same manner; and not unfrequently ten quires and
a half are returned for eleven quires borrowed; the consequence is,
that one signature has an overplus number and the other is deficient,
and has to be reprinted at the expense of the master printer: these
mistakes would not occur if the paper were given out in regular
tokens of ten quires eighteen sheets.


TOKEN SHEET.

In wetting paper the last sheet of each token is doubled down, so
that the corner projects, when there is a pile of paper wetted; this
projecting sheet marks the division of the pile into tokens, and is
styled the _token sheet_.


TOPS.

In piling the printed sheets of a work away, after they have been
dried and taken from the poles, the warehouseman takes a few sheets
of each signature, and lays them at the top of the pile; these are
called Tops, and enable him, with little trouble, to deliver a copy
as far as it is printed, when required, which frequently occurs in
the progress of a work, without having to take down all the piles.

TRAFALGAR.

The name of a type, the next size larger than Two Line Double Pica,
and smaller than Canon. It is a size that has been introduced of late
years.


TRANSPOSE.

In imposing, to place the pages in a wrong order, when it is said
the pages are transposed: in composing, if letters, or words,
or lines, do not follow in their proper order, they are said to
be transposed.--_M_. We use the word also when we correct the
arrangement, and put the pages or the matter in their proper order,
by saying we have transposed the pages, the words, or the lines.


TRANSPOSITION OF PAGES.

Many sizes, after the white paper in a half sheet has been worked
off, require some of the pages to be transposed, before the
reiteration is worked; for those sizes, _see_ IMPOSING.


TREADING PELT.

Trampling on the pelt, to make it soft and pliable, after it has
been soaked in the pelt pot, and to get rid of the superfluous
moisture, previous to knocking-up. This is usually done when the
pressmen are at work, and by him who is beating.

This is an inconvenient process when a man is working at half press;
but it may be dispensed with; for a pelt well curried will answer
equally well: it appears as if treading was the ancient practice,
before the currying iron was introduced.


TURN FOR A LETTER.

It often happens that when matter runs upon sorts, especially in
capitals, or some other sorts seldom used, that the compositor wants
that sort the matter runs on; wherefore he is loth to distribute
letter for that sort; or perhaps his case is otherwise full.
Wherefore, instead of that letter or sort, he turns a letter of the
same thickness, with the foot of the shank upwards, and the face
downwards; which turned letter being easy to be seen, he afterwards,
when he can accommodate himself with the right sort, takes out, and
puts the right letter in its room. It is also a word used jocosely in
the chapel, when any of the workmen complain of want of money, or any
thing else, it shall by another workman be answered, _Turn for it_;
viz. Make shift for it.--_M_.


TWENTY-FOURMO.

A sheet of paper folded into twenty-four leaves, forty-eight pages,
is termed twenty-fourmo.


TWENTYMO.

A sheet of paper folded into twenty leaves, forty pages, is termed
twentymo.


TWO LINE DOUBLE PICA.

The name of a type equal to four Small Picas, or to two Double Picas;
the next size larger than Two Line Great Primer, and smaller than
Trafalgar. It is not enumerated by Moxon in his list. _See_ TYPES.


TWO LINE ENGLISH.

The name of a type, the next size larger than Two Line Pica, and
smaller than Two Line Great Primer. It is equal to two English
bodies. _See_ TYPES.


TWO LINE GREAT PRIMER.

The name of a type, the next size larger than Two Line English, and
smaller than Two Line Double Pica. It is not enumerated in Moxon’s
list of the sizes of types. _See_ TYPES.


TWO LINE LETTERS.

Capitals that are equal to two bodies of any specific sized type.
There are Two Line Pearl, Two Line Nonpareil, &c., increasing
regularly to a Two Line Great Primer. They are used for lines in
titles and jobs, being so cast that the face covers the whole of the
square of the shank: they do not take so much room in depth as the
regular capitals of the same sized face, and are more convenient
where the matter is crowded; the face of the letter having also a
stronger stem, gives an additional variety in the effect. _See_
FULL-FACED LETTER.


TWO LINE PICA.

The name of a type, equal to two Picas; the next size larger than
Double Pica, and smaller than Two Line English. Moxon does not
enumerate this size in his list. _See_ TYPES.


TYMPAN.

A frame covered with parchment, on which the sheet of paper to be
printed is placed. This is the outer tympan; the inner tympan fits
into it, and between the parchments of the two the blankets are
placed, all which being run in receive the pressure of the platen,
which produces the impression on the paper.

Mr. T. C. Hansard took out a patent, for “Improvements on, and
Additions to, Printing Presses, and various Processes relative to
Printing;” in his description of them he says,--“My first Improvement
is the Dividing-Tympans, which are capable of being added to any
Printing Press, for the purpose of printing double-sized sheets of
paper, and then dividing or cutting such double-sized paper to the
ordinary size of single sheets of paper. These Tympans consist of,
first, the outer Tympan, of dimensions according to the size of the
Press or Work required: the additions to which are, a plate of Iron,
Steel, Brass, or other sufficient substance, about seven eighths of
an inch in width; the back side of which is level, but the front side
is raised in the middle, the centre part being about one fourth of
an inch in thickness, and the two sides about one eighth of an inch
only; along the middle or thicker part are cuts or openings, for
the purpose of admitting the knife hereinafter described, leaving
small parts of the plate uncut. On each side of the same, along the
centre of the thinner part, is a row of small holes, at about half
inch distances. This plate is fixed across the middle of the outer
Tympan, to each side, being countersunk into the same.--2ndly. The
inner Tympans are formed of two parts, having each part three sides,
and moving on pivots attached to the outer Tympan; these inner
Tympans, when shut down, are fastened in the common manner by hooks
and eyes or buttons, each part when opened to adjust the blankets
will incline back on the pivots. These Tympans I cover with black
Linen of the most fine and even texture, rolled and hot calendered:
taking a sufficient length in one piece to cover the one half of both
Tympans, then folding it in the middle, and laying each fold along
the side-rebate of the Plate over the holes, I then firmly attach it
thereto by strong sewing through the holes; I then turn one part of
the fold of the linen over the outer, and the other part over the
inner Tympans, and sew, or otherwise fasten, the same around the iron
work, or sides and ends of the Tympans, in the closest and neatest
manner, letting the hooks, eyes, or buttons, and pivots, through
the linen, and keeping clear the openings for the point screws by
carrying the linen on the inside, in the same manner as in putting
on common parchment; the same operation then takes place for the
other half of the Tympans. I then take pieces of Velvet, Velveteen,
or other uniform soft substance, which I attach, with the pile or
softest side outwards, to the linen already described as being
fastened to the Tympans, by sewing or pasting it to the outside of
the outer Tympan, to receive the Tympan-sheet, and by this means to
give a beautiful and regular impression of the Type: which mode of
covering Tympans I also apply to common Presses.

“The Divider or Knife is made of a plate of Iron or Steel, about
three-fourths of an inch wide, turned down at a right angle on one
side, about one-fourth of an inch in width, and in length sufficient
for the width of the sheet of paper intended to be cut, and this must
be fixed so as to be exactly corresponding to the openings in the
Plate before described; the part so turned down is cut into angular
teeth, about a quarter of an inch from point to point, each tooth
having two chisel-like edges, formed by being filed and dressed on
the outside of the part so turned down; on the inside of the angle
the teeth are to be finished all along fair and smooth. One or more
of the teeth are then to be filed out at intervals, corresponding
with the parts of the Plate left uncut. The Pivots or Joints of the
Tympans and Frisket being accurately adjusted, the Knife is then
fixed to the Frisket (at each end by screw or other connection) so
that when the Frisket is turned down on the Tympans the Knife shall
freely enter the Plate at the openings before described. The Plate
and Knife now occupying the usual place of Point Screws and Points,
those necessary articles are removed to the centre of each half of
the Tympans above and below the Plate. If wished, the positions
of the Plate and Knife may be reversed, by fixing the Plate to the
Frisket, and Knife to the Tympan, or a Plate both on Frisket and
Tympan, and Knife to the Forme, or Table of the Press, but not
with equal certainty of operation. All these parts being properly
adjusted, the mode of application is as follows:--For making ready a
Forme or Sheet, the Tympan-sheet is drawn on the Tympan, as in the
ordinary mode, and the Frisket pasted and cut out; but for working
the first side of the Paper, the Knife must be displaced (or, which
is sometimes preferable, two Friskets used, to be exchanged, one
having the Knife, and one without). The whole of the paper being
worked on one side without the Knife, the Knife is then replaced, or
the Friskets exchanged, and the Reiteration proceeded with; the sheet
will then be divided exactly along the centre, excepting at the parts
where the portions of the Plate have been left uncut, and the teeth
filed out of the Knife, as before described; which uncut parts answer
the important purpose of keeping the double-sheet adhering as one,
for the Pressman who may be _pulling_, to draw it off the Tympans
over to the Bank, where it is finally parted by the other man who is
_beating_, while looking over his heap, when six or seven sheets are
accumulated, by means of a gentle pressure with each hand at each
end of the heap. The white paper, or first side, is worked with four
points, placed opposite to each other in the middle fold of each half
of the double sheet, but for the Reiteration the two lower points are
taken off, and the sheet kept in register by the two upper ones only.
For cutting the sheet into more parts than two, I extend the same
principle by placing knives and plates in various positions, or at
right angles with each other.”


TYMPAN CLOTH.

A fine and even linen cloth, about an inch or two larger on every
side than the paper worked on: this cloth is wetted, and the water
wrung out again, so that it remains only moist: it is laid on the
tympan instead of a tympan sheet, the under sides of the corners
pasted to the tympan, and worked upon as a tympan sheet for the
reiteration. It is used to save paper, and it is repeatedly washed to
clear it of the ink that sets off on it.--_M._ It is not used now,
but set-off sheets are substituted for it.


TYMPAN HOOKS.

Small hooks fixed on the upper side of the outer tympan, which assist
in keeping the inner tympan in its place.

There are four of them, two on the off side and two on the near side,
screwed to the tympan, but not so tight as to prevent them turning
round on the screws as centres; there are four eyes screwed on the
inner tympan, opposite to them, and the hooks turn into these eyes
and draw the sides of the tympans together, and assist in tightening
the parchment of the inner tympan, and prevent its moving. In iron
presses, instead of eyes, buttons are used on the inner tympan, and
the hooks turn round them under the heads, and produce the same
effect.


TYMPAN JOINTS.

The joints by which the outer tympan is attached to the carriage, on
which it works. They are riveted to the bottom end of the tympan by
one of the sides, and the other side has an upright notch cut in it:
at the back of the hind part of the coffin are fixed two projecting
screws, at the same distance from each other as the notches in the
joints; these screws have a square plate or washer on each of them,
and a flat-headed female screw; the tympan joints are slipped over
these screws by the notches, so that they bestride each screw, and
are confined by the female screw and washer. The tympan can thus
be adjusted to any height, by loosening the screws and sliding the
joints up or down. The pin that connects the two parts of the joints
is stout, and made to slip out when necessary. These joints should
be particularly well made, and have no play; if they have, it will
cause maculing and doubles in the work.


TYMPAN SHEET.

A sheet of paper pasted on the tympan at the corners, as a standing
mark to lay all the other sheets exactly even upon, while the white
paper is working.--_M._ It is now also used for the reiteration.
When a pressman has laid a form on the press stone, and fixed it
in its situation, he takes a sheet of its own paper, or a sheet of
some other paper of the same size, and folds it exactly, so that the
folds shall be his guide for laying it on the form; he then lays a
sheet of waste paper on the form to preserve his tympan sheet clean,
and places it truly on the form over the other, by means of the
folds falling on the middle of the crosses and feeling the types
through it with his fingers, so that the margin at both sides of the
sheet shall be precisely equal, as also at both ends; he wets his
tympan slightly, to take out the indentions made by the types of a
preceding form, and generally rubs a very small quantity of paste on
the parchment, being careful that there are no lumps; he then turns
the tympan down upon the form, runs in the carriage, and gives it a
slight pull, to cause it to adhere to the tympan; he then pastes the
four corners down, but tears off a piece of the near bottom corner,
to prevent him catching hold of it, in the quick taking the printed
sheet off the tympan, when working.


TYPES.

The letters, marks, and signs, cast in metal, the larger sizes of
wood, with which printing is executed.

The forms and proportions of types in the Roman character have
undergone every change that the most capricious fancy could suggest.
We have types of beautiful shapes and symmetrical proportions, but
our type founders have diverged, for the sake of variety, gradually
to a fatter face till the lines have become so thick that the letter
has hardly any white in its interior, and when printed is nearly all
black, with the outline only to guide us in knowing what it is; and
on the contrary they have gradually gone to the other extreme, and
produced what are called skeleton letters, which are formed of a
fine uniform line; we have antique, the line being also of uniform
thickness, but strong and heavy; we have letters with the strong
lines and the fine lines reversed; we have tall narrow letters, and
we have letters which look as if they had been pressed down, till
they were considerably broader than they were high; we have letters
drawn in perspective, with their edges towards us, as if they were
marching away; and as for Italic, we have it now inclining to the
left as well as to the right. The Modern Gothic or Black letter has
not escaped this rage for change and variety, and we have forms
introduced into it which would have puzzled our ancestors to know
what they were meant for when the Modern Gothic was the standard
character.

These changes and varieties have not been introduced as improvements
either in the forms or proportions of the letters, but to produce
variety and what is styled effect.

The scale of sizes of the respective types can only be looked at
and received as an approximation to truth, as the letter founders
themselves acknowledge; in fact there is no precise standard,
for they cast according to the orders they receive from their
customers: the following scale is a proof of this; Mr. Hansard, in
his Typographia, gives the number of lines of each size in a foot
as cast in the foundery of Messrs. Caslon and Livermore, which does
not agree with the one I now give, which was supplied to me by Mr.
Livermore in 1839, at my request, avowedly to publish, each fount
having been measured to insure correctness; it was submitted to Mr.
Caslon personally in August 1841, before printing, and revised, so
that every precaution has been taken to prevent a mistake. The scale
of the foundery of Messrs. V. and J. Figgins, as also that of Messrs.
Thorowgood and Besley, were kindly furnished me by the respective
houses. I have also given Moxon’s scale of sizes, which is the oldest
that has been published, and which will show the variations in the
depth of body which types have undergone. He prefaces it by saying,
“And that the reader may the better understand the sizes of these
several _Bodies_, I shall give him this Table following; wherein
is set down the number of each _Body_ that is contained in one
Foot”--_See_ NICKS.

  +---------------------+------+-------+---------+-----------+-----------+

It thus appears that in 1683, the date of Moxon’s work, there
were only ten sizes of types with specific names, while at the
present time we have twenty-one; the following are our additional
sizes--Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, Minion, Bourgeois, Small Pica,
Paragon, Two Line Pica, Two Line Great Primer, Two Line Double Pica,
and Trafalgar.

Canon is the largest size with a specific name; all above Canon are
designated according to the number of Picas in the depth of the body;
thus the next size larger is Five Line Pica, then Six Line Pica, and
so on indefinitely. Twenty-four Line Pica is about the largest letter
that is cast in metal, those above that size are generally cut in
wood, as also any peculiar shaped letters. The German letter founders
cast the face of letters in metal to a much larger size, and mount
them on wood.

Minion used to be half an English; it has ceased to be so, and
Emerald has taken its place, for English is now equal to two
Emeralds: this latter is a size that was introduced about two years
ago.

By an examination of the preceding table the relative proportions
of the different sizes to each other will be ascertained; but to
facilitate the reference they are here brought under one view.

  Diamond = Half Bourgeois, also = ¼ Great Primer = ⅛ Two Line
  Great Primer.

  Pearl = Half Long Primer, also = ¼ Paragon.

  Ruby = Half Small Pica, also = ¼ Double Pica = ⅛ Two Line Double
  Pica.

  Nonpareil = Half Pica.

  Emerald = Half English.

  Bourgeois = Half Great Primer, also = 2 Diamonds.

  Long Primer = Half Paragon, also = 2 Pearls.

  Small Pica = Half Double Pica, also = 2 Rubies.

  Pica = 2 Nonpareils.

  English = 2 Emeralds.

  Great Primer = 2 Bourgeois, also = 4 Diamonds.

  Paragon = 2 Long Primers, also = 4 Pearls.

  Double Pica = 2 Small Picas, also = 4 Rubies.

  Two Line Pica = 2 Picas, also = 4 Nonpareils.

  Two Line English = 2 English, also = 4 Emeralds.

  Two Line Great Primer = 2 Great Primers, also = 4 Bourgeois = 8
  Diamonds.

  Two Line Double Pica = 2 Double Picas, also = 4 Small Picas = 8
  Rubies.

  Canon = 2 Two Line Picas, also = 4 Picas = 8 Nonpareils.

It thus appears that Minion, Brevier, and Trafalgar, may be classed
as irregular bodied letters, for they bear no specific regular
proportion to any other size.

Minion was formerly half an English, but it has varied in the depth
of its body from that proportion; some of the letter founders have
introduced a new size between Minion and Nonpareil, and called it
Emerald, and made this new type half an English; I think it would
have been a preferable measure to have restored Minion to its
original place.

This want of uniformity in the depth of body of the respective sizes
is much to be regretted, as it causes serious inconvenience in a
printing office, and might be avoided by the several letter founders
agreeing among themselves and deciding what should be the standard
for each size, and firmly refuse to cast a new fount to any other
size, reserving the present variations for imperfections only,
till the founts in use were worn out and discarded; we should thus
gradually approach to uniformity; and whatever variations there might
be in the face of the letter, still the quadrats and the spaces might
be used to any fount of the same sized letter, without any risk of
injuring the appearance of the work, and this would frequently be
found of great advantage in poetry, figure work, and in light open
matter.

This evil is not confined to England, but exists to a great extent
in both France and Germany, and Fournier, an eminent letter founder
who wrote on the subject, describes the evil, and explains the
remedy which he invented and adopted, in his “Manuel Typographique,”
published at Paris, in two volumes 12mo. 1764, of which the following
is a translation.

“This article requires a particular explanation, because it is
novel and obscure. I have placed it here in order to show the new
proportions which I have given to the _body of the characters_, by
the defined measures which I call _Typographical Points_.

“The last regulation of the Library, made in 1725, fixed _the height
to paper_ at ten and a half geometric lines. This rule is as easy
to practise as it is to give; but such was not the case when it was
desirable by this regulation to establish some rules in order to
fix the _strength of the body_ of the characters. At the time when
this regulation was made, apparently no person was found competent
to give correct ideas on that point, which was very important, as it
would operate to correct abuse, and to give order and precision where
there had never been any before. In default of proper information, a
master printer gave as a rule the characters which he found in his
own printing office, with all their imperfections. The law which was
then obtained, not being founded on any principles, has consequently
remained unexecuted, which is the reason why the characters have
never had fixed and accurate sizes, and that this disorder still
remains as great as it was formerly.

“In article lix. of this Regulation, it is given, as a _fit body_,
that _Petit-canon is equal to two Saint-Augustins; Gros-parangon is
equal to a Cicero and a Petit-romain, &c._, but the size that the
Saint-Augustin, the Cicero, or the Petit-romain ought to have is not
given, in order to make together the Petit-canon or Gros-parangon.
Consequently this law can always be evaded, and it is evaded whenever
any one wishes, without being liable to any penalty, because one
person might make a body of Saint-Augustin more slender than another,
and the Petit-canon might be cast to this double thickness, by which
means the law would be fulfilled. Another person might make the body
of Saint-Augustin more or less strong, and from two of these bodies
he will cast a Petit-canon: here again the law is fulfilled, although
in a spirit opposed to that of the Regulation. Thus confusion is
perpetuated, until at length it gives one some trouble to make the
distinction of the two bodies, of which the larger is weak and the
smaller strong. It happens then that the characters of the same body
vary more or less, and when two such are found in a printing office,
the workmen mix the spaces and quadrats together, which spoils the
founts.

“The Regulation has provided for this default, it will be said, when
it ordains that there should be sent to the founders a certain number
of letters of each body, in order that they might agree under pain
of fine. But these letters which are thus proposed at hazard, and
which are never given, would not have remedied the evil which it is
wished to avoid. These pretended rules, instead of causing order and
precision, on the contrary augment the confusion, by multiplying
the parts without necessity. From thence it comes that the bodies
of Petit-canon, Gros-parangon, Gros-romain, Cicero, Philosophie,
Gaillarde, Mignone, are found, according to the Regulation,
without double bodies, on which two-line letters can be made, of
which nevertheless none of the bodies can do without. Here then
are seven or eight bodies without names, useless for every other
purpose, and with which the printing office is overloaded. Moreover,
these combinations of the body of a Cicero and a Petit-romain
to make a Gros-parangon, of a Petit-texte and Petit-romain to
make a Gros-romain, of a Petit-texte and a Nonpareille to make a
Saint-Augustin, truly proclaim little experience and capacity on the
part of those who proposed them. The defect has been perceived, but
no one has tried to find a remedy, and that because the printers, who
are alone consulted in this affair, are not type founders sufficient
to make proper experiments, and to give rules to a part of the trade
which they do not exercise, and of which often they know only the
name.

“This then is what engaged me to disentangle this chaos, and to give
to these matters an order which they have never before had. I think
I have had the happiness to succeed in it, with an exactness and
precision which leaves nothing to be desired, by the invention of
_Typographical Points_. It is nothing more than the division of the
bodies of characters by equal and determinate degrees, which I call
_Points_. By this means, the degrees of distance and the affinity of
the bodies may be known exactly. They can be combined together in the
same manner as numerical signs; and as two and two make four, add
two, it will become six, double all this, you will have twelve, &c.,
in the like manner a Nonpareille, which is equal to six points, added
to another Nonpareille will make together a Cicero, which has twelve
points, add again a Nonpareille, you will have eighteen points or a
Gros-romain, double all this, and it will make thirty-six points, or
a Trismegiste, which has that number; and in like manner the others,
as may be seen by a reference to the _Table of Proportions_ which
follows.

“In order to combine the bodies, it will be sufficient to know the
number of _Typographical Points_ of which they are composed. These
points or given sizes should be invariable, so that they may serve
as guides in the printing office, as the _foot_, _inch_, and _line_
are used in geometry. For this purpose, I have fixed these points
at the exact sizes they ought to have, in the scale which is at the
head of the _Table of Proportions_; and that their exactness may be
relied upon invariably, I have contrived an instrument which I call
_Prototype_.

“The invention of these points is the first service which I rendered
to printing, in 1737. Obliged then to commence a long, painful, and
laborious career by the graving of all the punches necessary to form
the establishment of my foundery, I found no rule established which
could guide me in fixing the body of the characters which I had to
make, and I was thus under the necessity of forming them for myself.

“The table exhibits at the top a fixed and definite scale, which I
divide into two inches, the inches into twelve lines, and the line
into six of these typographical points; the total is 144 points. The
first small divisions are of two points, which is the exact distance
which there is from a Petit-texte to a Petit-romain, or from that
to a Cicero, &c. The scale contains in the whole twelve bodies of
Cicero. It is necessary to measure by this gauge the number of points
which I assign to each of the bodies. These measures, taken truly
for each body separately, and verified on the _Prototype_, will form
altogether a general correspondence for all the bodies of characters.”

“_Of Height to Paper._ The height of the characters called _height
to paper_, that is to say, from the foot to the face which leaves
its impression on the paper, is fixed by regulations of the book
trade, and noted down by them, on the 28th February 1723, at ten and
a half geometric lines. This law was established for rendering all
the French characters conformable in their parts, in order that,
passing from one printing office to another, by the death of the
proprietor or otherwise, there might be no disparity among them.
This law, however, though wise and good, is but partially executed,
many printers having adhered to the height of the characters which
they found already in their offices. Some countries, as Flanders,
the Lyonnois, and others, which have the characters much higher by
the ordonnance of the Porte, have preserved them thus, so that from
these causes we see the characters varying from ten and a quarter
to eleven lines and a half high. Those who have preserved them in
this last way are among the dupes, because the characters which are
according to the ordonnance cost a hundred pistoles, while those that
have more metal in them are worth eleven hundred francs, because
being one eleventh higher are one eleventh heavier.

“The officers of the chambres syndicals have neglected this part of
the regulation; thus nothing is more common than to see in every
printing office, the characters some a little too high and some a
little too low. This makes it necessary to put the highest upon the
tympans of the press within the places where the lines are too low.
Sometimes many folds of paper are put under these low types upon the
stone of the press, in order to raise the low parts up to the level
of the high ones. This confusion does not originate with the founder,
who is obliged to conform to the will of those for whom he works.
Three parts of the French printers, at least, have their printing
offices regulated according to the measure of ten lines and a half;
and though there may be little inequalities which leave some of the
characters a little too high and some a little too low, yet when
there is only this slight difference, perhaps being sometimes but the
thickness of a paper, the inequality is very inconsiderable. To avoid
this confusion, and to make the founderies preserve one standard to
regulate the height, and preserve it always the same, rests with the
master. There are two ways: the first is a thin plate of copper or
iron on which is made a notch of ten lines and a half high, and the
other, which is in greater use and more convenient, is making a form
of justification.”

The French have varied from Fournier’s standard, and have introduced
fresh sizes since he published his work; when Fertel wrote, in 1723,
he gave a list of nineteen sizes, but at the present time they have
twenty-five; they are also changing their names, and now designate
them by numbers, as will be perceived by the following list, which
is copied from the specimen book of De la Tarbe, of Paris, 1835,
to which I have affixed the number of points assigned to them by
Fournier.

The German letter founders vary still more than the English or the
French, for there is no standard body in Germany, every printing
office has its varieties; the height is equally very different,
but generally much higher than the French types. The German scale
is formed by dividing their Petit, a size between our Brevier and
Bourgeois, into four lines, so that each additional number is one
fourth of their Petit. The names of many of the sizes also vary in
different parts of Germany. The list that I give, with the number
of lines to each size, I was favoured with by Mr. Edward Hænel, of
Magdeburg, an eminent printer of extensive business; I have other
lists, of letter founders, in different parts of Germany, but I do
not think it necessary to insert more than one.

The German letter founders have types for printing maps, with which
they form the line of the sea coast, with all its irregularities, its
promontories, its bays, &c., the boundary lines, and the rivers. I
had a map, printed in this manner, sent to me from Germany, which is
very clever, and shows great ingenuity in the execution.

The Italian types are of a rather less body than the corresponding
English types, but I have not been able to ascertain the precise
degree of variation. I was favoured with this list by Mr. And. Pons,
a printer at Parma, who originally belonged to the establishment of
the celebrated printer Bodoni.

The Foreign Monthly Review for June, 1839, states that a type founder
of Clermont, named Colson, has obtained a patent for a new material
for printing types, which is harder, capable of more resistance,
and yet less expensive than the ordinary composition of lead and
antimony. It is well known, that types cast from the latter soon
become worn, especially since the introduction of machine-printing.
Colson asserts that the material is so hard that the types themselves
will serve for punches in striking matrices, and that it will last
ten years, without being more worn than the usual composition is in
one year.


TYPE FOUNDERS. _See_ LETTER FOUNDERS.




U.


ULTIMATE.

The last syllable of a word.


UNDERHAND.

A phrase used by pressmen for the light and easy, or heavy and hard,
running in of the carriage. Thus they say, The press goes light and
easy _under hand_, or it goes heavy or hard under hand.--_M._


UNDERLAYS.

Pieces of paper pasted on the bottom of an engraving on wood,
to raise it to the proper height to print with types, &c. If an
engraving be hollow on the face of it, then a small underlay under
the hollow part will raise that part by means of the pressure in
printing it at press, and prevent the necessity of using too many
overlays.


UNEVEN PAGE.

The same as ODD PAGE, which _see_. Smith uses the term.


UNLOCK THE FORM.

To loosen the quoins for the purpose of correcting; and also for
laying-up; or for any other purpose.


UPPER HAND.

When the spindle goes soft and easy, the pressmen say, it goes well
_over hand_ or _above hand_. But the contrary if it goes hard and
heavy.--_M._




V.


VANTAGE.

When a white page or more happens in a sheet, the compositor calls
that VANTAGE: so does the pressman, when a form of one pull comes to
the press.--_M._ At the present day it is termed Fat, which _see_.


VARNISH.

With which ink is made.--_M._


VESPER, or PLAIN CHANT MUSIC.

The Gregorian Plain Chant is governed by two clefs, the _Ut_ clef,
and the _Fa_ clef; which correspond to the tenor and base clefs in
modern music.

[Illustration: Ut Clef. Fa Clef.]

The use of these clefs is to point out the progression of tones and
semi-tones, and to determine the key or tone of the chant, which is
commonly contained in a staff of four lines; but as it frequently
happens that the music exceeds that compass, the clefs necessarily
change their places on the staff to give a greater scope to the
chant; therefore on whatsoever line of the staff the _Ut_ clef is
placed, that line is called _Ut_, the rest of the notes following in
the same progression. The same rule applies to the _Fa_ clef,

[Illustration: ut re mi fa sol la si ut.]

The bars which nearly cross the staff, are used to separate the notes
sung to each word; the bars which entirely cross the staff are used
over some period in the reading; the double bar is placed at the end
of a strain or verse.

The diamond shaped note is half the length of the square note; the
notes with the tails are double the length, or equal in time to two
square notes, (but these must not be mistaken for notes which, having
tails, are only meant to tie them to other notes higher or lower on
the staff.) A dot placed after a note increases its value one half.
Sharps are not used in plain chant. Flats and naturals have the same
power as in modern music.

In the following example, the bars are used to divide the melody into
equal portions.

Stabat mater--in G major.

[Illustration: Stabat mater do-lo-ro-sa juxta crucem la-cry-mo-sa,
dum pendebat fi-li-us.]

The same in modern notation.

[Illustration: Stabat mater do-lo-ro-sa juxta crucem la-cry-mo-sa,
dum pendebat fi-li-us.]

Since the decease of Mr. Hughes, the punches, matrixes, &c. of the
above founts of music types (and that mentioned at page 490) have
been purchased by Mr. C. Hancock, of Middle Row, Holborn, by whom
they have been considerably improved, and by whom the profession are
supplied.


VISORUM.

Some compositors use visorums. Therefore pricking the point of the
visorum, most commonly upon the border or frame of the case on the
left hand about the & box, they fold the leaf of copy they compose
by, so as the bottom of it may rest upon the square shoulder near
the bottom of the visorum; then with two pieces of scaleboard tied
together at one end, they clasp both the copy and visorum between
these two scaleboards, which two scaleboards pinch the copy and
visorum fast enough to keep the copy in its place, and at the same
time also serves for an index to direct the eye to every line, as the
compositor moves it downward.--_M._

This article is not used now; though it appears to me, from Moxon’s
account, to be both useful and convenient.

[Illustration: A visorum]




W.


WASH.

If a workman is in the habit of telling improbable tales, or of
asserting falsehoods, as the chapel does not allow the lie direct to
be given, neither do any choose to get into a personal quarrel by
doing it, it is usual, in order to express the general disbelief,
to wash him, as it is termed; that is, each person with a piece
of furniture, or some other substance, will strike repeatedly and
quickly upon the front of his frame, upon the ledge of his lower
case, or upon his bulk; and this being done by every person in the
room, where there are a great number employed, it raises such a loud
drumming as is deafening, more particularly when they give what they
call a “good” wash: this is customary both in the composing room
and the press room. For the old manner of doing this, _see_ ANCIENT
CUSTOMS.


WASH THE FORM.

If a form gets foul in working, the pressmen will take it off the
press and brush it over with lye, and after that rinse it with clean
water, to remove the foulness. He also washes the form when the given
number is all printed.--_M._


WASTE.

The surplus sheets of a work.

After a work has been finished at press and dried, it is gathered,
collated, the gatherings folded and pressed, and then booked, if
it contain more gatherings than one; and when the regular number
of copies has been made up, the surplus sheets, which vary in
number, are tied up in a bundle, and termed Waste: out of this waste
deficient sheets are supplied, and damaged sheets exchanged. It is
always delivered to the publisher with the last copies of the work.


WAYZ GOOSE.

A stubble goose.--_Bailey._ Called Way Goose, and so spelt by Moxon.
_See_ ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

July is the month in which the different offices in the metropolis
generally have each their Way Goose, or annual dinner, and Saturday
is the day commonly chosen.


WEAK INK. _See_ SOFT INK.--_M._

In common work, where despatch is requisite, weak ink is used; it
distributes with more facility than strong ink, and enables the
pressmen to make a greater riddance. It receives its name from the
varnish not being made so tenacious as that for better ink.


WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

  5 & 6 W. 4. c. 63. § 31.--“And be it enacted, That from and
  after the First Day of January One thousand eight hundred and
  thirty-six, if any Person or Persons shall print, or if the Clerk
  of any Market or other Person shall make any Return, Price List,
  Price Current, or any Journal or other Paper containing Price
  List or Price Current, in which the Denomination of Weights and
  Measures quoted or referred to shall denote or imply a greater
  or less Weight or Measure than is denoted or implied by the
  same Denomination of the Imperial Weights and Measures under
  and according to the Provisions of this Act, such Person or
  Persons or Clerk of the Market shall forfeit and pay any Sum not
  exceeding Ten Shillings for every Copy of such Return, Price
  List, Price Current, Journal or other Paper which he or they
  shall publish.”


WELSH.

The Welsh alphabet, as now popularly used, contains twenty-eight
letters: _a_, _b_, _c_, _ch_, _d_, _dd_, _e_, _f_, _ff_, _g_, _ng_,
_h_, _i_, _l_, _ll_, _m_, _n_, _o_, _p_, _ph_, _rh_, _r_, _s_, _t_,
_th_, _u_, _w_, _y_.

_J_, _q_, _x_, and _z_, are not properly Welsh letters, nor are they
wanted in words purely Welsh.

_K_ and _v_ occur frequently in old Welsh, but are now generally
disused; the place of the former is supplied by _c_, which always has
the hard sound, and that of the latter by _f_.

In addition to the common accented letters, the Welsh requires _ŵ_
and _ŷ_ to be accented likewise; as, gŵr, _a man_; tŷ, _a house_.

Of the twenty-one Welsh consonants twelve are immutable, namely,
_ch_, _dd_, _f_, _ff_, _ng_, _k_, _l_, _n_, _ph_, _r_, _s_, _th_;
the remaining nine, _b_, _c_, _d_, _g_, _ll_, _m_, _p_, _rh_, _t_,
are mutable. These are divisible into three classes of three letters
each. The first, containing _c_, _t_, _p_, is susceptible of three
kinds of modification, viz. the obtuse, the liquid, and the aspirate;
the second class, comprising _g_, _d_, _b_, is affected by two kinds,
the obtuse and the liquid; and the third, comprising _ll_, _m_, _rh_,
is susceptible of the obtuse form only.

The following table will show at one view the various changes of the
mutable initial consonants:--


  +------------------+----------------+----------+----------+
  |Primitive Letters.|     Obtuse.    |  Liquid. | Aspirate.|
  +------------------+----------------+----------+----------+
  |             {c   |       g        |   ngh    |    ch    |
  |CLASS I.     {t   |       d        |    nh    |    th    |
  |             {p   |       b        |    mh    |    ph    |
  |                  |                |          |          |
  |             {g   |initial omitted.|    ng    |          |
  |CLASS II.    {d   |    dd _or_ dh  |     n    |          |
  |             {b   |       f        |     m    |          |
  |                  |                |          |          |
  |             {ll  |       l        |          |          |
  |CLASS III.   {m   |       f        |          |          |
  |             {rh  |       r        |          |          |
  +------------------+----------------+----------+----------+

The following examples may be given to show more clearly the nature
of these mutations:--1. Câr, _a kinsman_; 2. Gwâs, _a servant_.

  Primitive. Câr agos, _a near kinsman_.
  Obtuse.    Ei gâr, _his kinsman_.
  Liquid.    Fy nghâr, _my kinsman_.
  Aspirate.  Ei châr, _her kinsman_.

  Gwâs ffyddlon, _a faithful servant_.
  Ei wâs, _his servant_.
  Fy ngwâs, _my servant_.

The obtuse sound is assumed after--

  1. All verbs, except of the infinitive mood, and interjections.

  2. All personal pronouns; the possessives DY, _thy_; MAU, _mine_;
  TAU, _thine_; and EI (masc.) _his_; but not when fem.; the
  relatives PA, _which_; PWY, _who_; and À, _that_.

  3. Adjectives and formative adverbs, and interjections.

  4. The duals DAU and DWY, _two_.

  5. All prepositions, except YN, _in_, and TUA, _towards_.

  6. Pronominal prepositions.

  7. The article Y, _the_, if the object be feminine.

  8. The participial sign YN.

  9. The disjunctive sign NEU, _or_.

The liquid sound is assumed after--

  1. The possessive pronoun MY or FY, _my_.

  2. The word YN when used as the English preposition _in_.

The aspirate sound is assumed after--

  1. The possessive pronoun EI (fem.) _her_.

  2. The adverbs TRA, _over_; and NI, and NA, _not_.

  3. The conjunctions A, _and_; NO, _than_; NEU, _or_; and ONI,
  _unless_.

  4. The preposition Â, _with_.

  5. The numerals TRI, _three_; and CHWE, _six_.

All vowel initials take _h_ before them, after EI (fem.) _her_; EIN,
_our_; and EU, _their_.

Welsh substantives do not vary in their terminations, but the cases
are distinguished by prepositions changing their initial letters, if
mutable, according to their dependance on the preceding word; as,
N. tŷ, _a house_; G. dodrefn fy nhŷ, _the furniture of my house_;
A. prynodd dŷ, _he bought a house_; Ab. allan o’i thŷ, _out of her
house_.

DEG, ten, and PYMTHEG, _fifteen_, before BLYNEDD, _years_, not only
change the initial of the following word into its corresponding
liquid, but likewise suffer a variation themselves; thus, for DEG
BLYNEDD and PYMTHEG BLYNEDD we find DENG MLYNEDD and PYMTHENG
MLYNEDD; and for PUMP BLYNEDD we read PUM MLYNEDD, _five years_.

WELL.

On the bottom side of the two cross bearers in the middle of a frame,
on which the inner ends of the lower cases rest, there is frequently
a bottom nailed of thin deal; this, when the ends of the cases are
close together, forms a receptacle in which the compositor puts copy
and other articles, and it is named a _Well_. To obtain access to it
he slides one of the cases a little away from the other.


WETTING PAPER.

In quoting my old pressman’s observations again, it will be perceived
that he is speaking of the practice when pelt balls were in use.

“When a pressman is engaged to work in a strange office, if there be
no balls for him, he puts an old and a new pelt into the pelt pot,
and, while his pelts are soaking, he inquires whether he has to wet
paper or not; if he has to wet it, he does it in a large trough lined
with lead, containing clean water. He holds the middle of the back
of each quire in one hand, and the fore edge with the other hand,
and draws it quickly through the water, the back first; lays it on a
clean wrapper (which is laid on a clean paper board); opens part of
the quire, leaves that part on the board, and draws the remainder of
the quire, and all the other quires in the same proportion, through
the water as often as necessary, till he has wet all the heap; then
he places another paper board on the top of the heap, and puts
sufficient weight on it; in this state it continues till the paper is
all properly damped, by the moisture becoming diffused through the
whole heap, except it be for fine work, when he turns the paper as
often as he thinks necessary, pressing it at each turning; and common
work would look better if the paper were turned.

“Paper for different works being of various qualities, it is
impossible to form a regular judgment of how many dips in each quire
all sorts of paper require; therefore the wetter must be cautious in
examining, while wetting, whether each sort is of a soft, or spongy,
middling, hard, or harsh nature; also to consider whether it be for a
light or a heavy form, and dip each sort accordingly.”

In large establishments the pressmen do not wet the paper, but there
is one or more persons appointed to that duty solely, who also turn
it and press it, so that it is delivered to the pressmen to print,
more uniformly in good condition, than where they wet it. _See_
TOKEN. TOKEN SHEET.


WHEEL.

Also called girt wheel, and drum; a cylinder of elm wood, with two
flat broad grooves turned in it, on which the two girts wind and
unwind alternately, as the carriage is run in and out. It is fixed on
the spit, and one end of each girt is nailed to it; the other ends
are fastened, the one that runs the carriage in to the end of the
coffin, and the other to the fore end of the plank. The diameter of
the wheel varies according to the size of the press.


WHITE LINE.

A line of quadrats.--_M._ So it is usually understood at present; yet
it frequently happens that quadrats are not in sufficient quantity
to use for white lines, even for the bottoms of the pages; reglet of
a proper thickness is then substituted for quadrats, and sometimes
leads, but these should never be used for this purpose--for a volume
or a pamphlet may be wanted in a great hurry in the same measure, and
then an inconvenience may arise from the leads being blocked up in an
unnecessary manner.


WHITE PAGE.

A page that no matter comes in.--_M._


WHITE PAPER.

Although the first form be printed off, yet pressmen erroneously call
that heap white paper, till the reiteration be printed.--_M._ This
application of the term is now wearing away; and generally speaking,
it is only used for paper not printed upon; when the pressmen are
printing the first form of a sheet or the first side of a half sheet,
they say they are working the white paper.


WHITE PAPER REGISTER.

Pulling an impression without ink, or with a sheet of waste paper
between the form and the paper for the work, for the purpose of
ascertaining that the furniture is right. This is a good old custom,
and it is a pity that it is now so seldom practised, as it would
prevent those mistakes of wrong furniture which occasionally occur in
the white paper form, and when this happens, which I have known at
different times, the only remedy is, either to cancel what has been
printed, or to alter the reiteration form to make it register with
that which is printed, to the disfigurement of the book when it is
bound.


WHOLE PRESS. _See_ FULL PRESS.--_M._


WIDE SPACING,

is when en quadrats, or two thick spaces, are used between the words.


WILKINS, BEATA. _See_ DONATIONS.


WINTER.

A solid piece of wood, generally elm, similar to the head of a press,
mortised into the cheeks below the carriage and the long ribs, and on
which they rest.

I would recommend, contrary to the general practice, that in wooden
presses the winter should lie solid in the mortises of the cheeks,
and have no spring; and that all the spring should be in the head,
which would not affect the perpendicular descent of the platen.
This method of constructing a press would be found advantageous in
all cases; but more particularly in one-pull presses, in which the
platens are large:--

For it must be obvious, where an uniform impression is meant to be
obtained from types, by means of the perpendicular descent of a body
with a plane surface, that this surface and the surface of the types
should be parallel to each other, and that every variation from these
parallels must affect the equality of the pressure.

It being a necessary consequence, that the surface of the types
should be horizontal; it will be equally clear, that every departure
from this horizontal line will destroy the parallelism of the two
surfaces, and prevent an equal pressure on all their parts.

One part of the carriage of a press lies on the winter, the other
end resting on, and confined to, the forestay, which is fixed to
the floor, and cannot give way; the coffin, in which is the press
stone, lies on the carriage; and on the press stone the types are
placed. Now, when great pressure is applied to the types, to produce
an impression, it causes the winter to give way, which immediately
disturbs the horizontal plane of the types, and destroys the parallel
between them and the face of the platen, and causes an unequal
pressure, besides straining the cords of the platen, the platen
itself, and all the parts connected with it, to the injury of the
workmanship, and of the whole machine; all which would be avoided by
the winter being laid solid in the mortises of the cheeks, and the
carriage and ribs justified by a level. It would also be attended
with another advantage,--not being so liable to slur in running in;
the inner tympan not being so close to the platen.

This principle is equally applicable to iron presses, as well as to
wooden ones; and will tend to preserve them a longer time in good
condition.


WOODEN RIBS.

That part of the frame in a wooden press on which the long ribs
are fastened; in the middle they lie on the winter where the under
resistance to the pressure is, and are kept in their place by the
summer; and at the fore end they are supported by the fore stay; it
is necessary that they should be perfectly level.


WOOL CARDS.

Made with strong wire; one of which is fastened to two pieces of wood
that go across the wool hole, and the other has two open handles
fixed to the back of it, for the purpose of carding the wool with
which the balls are stuffed.


WOOL HOLE.

A place boxed off sometimes under a stair case, or in any situation
where the dust will not affect the press room, or other departments
of the business--in which the wool is carded wherewith to make the
balls.

The wool is kept in the box, over which two pieces of wood are
stretched across and fastened down, lowest in the front; on these one
of the cards is fixed. In the act of carding the wool the dust and
refuse fall into the box, and are thus prevented from being trampled
about.


WOOL HOLE. The workhouse. When a compositor or pressman is reduced by
age or illness to take refuge in the workhouse, it is said he is in
the _Wool Hole_.


WORKED, or WORKED-OFF.

When a job, or the sheet of a work is printed, it is said to be
Worked, or Worked-off. _See_ OFF.


WORK WITH A FIGURE.

In printing offices where there are a number of presses employed, it
is usual to distinguish them by numbers; as 1st press, 2d press, &c.;
and the pressmen put a figure into each form they work, corresponding
to the number of their press, for the purpose of ascertaining readily
at which press a sheet was printed in case of bad workmanship, or any
accident; and in general pressmen are subject to a fine if they work
without a figure, or with a wrong one: but when the same press works
both the forms of a sheet, it is not necessary to have a figure in
more than one form.

The figure used to be placed regularly in a white line at the bottom
of an even page, about four ems from the fore edge: it was placed in
an even page that it might not mislead the bookbinder; and always in
a full page that did not finish a paragraph.

SCANDINAVIAN PRESS.

A new press has just been introduced to public notice (August 1841),
under the patronage of Count Rosen, a Swedish nobleman, but being
too late for insertion in the alphabetical order, I give a notice
of it at the end. There are two of these presses now at work in the
extensive establishment of Messrs. William Clowes and Sons, under
the name of “The Scandinavian Self-inking Press,” invented by Mr.
C. A. Holm, of Stockholm, who has taken out a patent for it. It is
a press with a platen which descends perpendicularly, and at its
regular rate of working produces 550 impressions in an hour, which
I have ascertained by personal inspection. It requires two boys
to each press to lay on and take off the paper, and to turn down
and raise the tympan, and one superintendent is fully competent to
attend to two presses. By dispensing with woollen blankets in the
tympans and substituting paper, it produces fine impressions, as
the specimens published of large and finely executed engravings on
wood testify. There is a contrivance which causes a rest or pause
when the pressure is at its maximum, and gives time for the ink to
be firmly attached to the paper. The motive power may be either hand
labour or steam, those in use at Messrs. Clowes’s establishment are
worked by steam; they do not occupy more room than any other press
that will print paper of the same dimensions, and are very simple
in their construction. The inking apparatus is so arranged that
the distributing rollers have three or four different motions, the
object and effect of which are to produce a perfectly equal and
uniform distribution of the ink. They are manufactured by Messrs.
Braithwaite, Milner, and Co., engineers, in the New Road.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
